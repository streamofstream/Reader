<p><strong><em>Naomi Oreskes*</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVITY AND WOMEN IN SCIENCE</strong></p>
<p>Of course, it is occasionally necessary to make experiments which one knows are dangerous, for example, in determining how a disease is transmitted. A number of people have died this way, and it is to my mind the ideal way of dying. <strong>-J.</strong> B. S. Haldane</p>
<p>CENTRAL THEME of Margaret Rossiter&#39;s pioneering work on women scien­ tists in America is that the false mythology of science as an almost exclusively</p>
<p>male preserve has been made possible by the near invisibility of women scientists. Women have been present in American science throughout the nineteenth and twen­ tieth centuries, but their contributions have been placed in the background rather than the foreground of scientific innovation and discovery. The invisibility of wom­ en&#39;s contributions is enmeshed with the question of why some kinds of scientific work are more valued and honored than others. Thus, some scholars have attempted to understand and evaluate women&#39;s contributions in the context of the epistemic values of science. Feminist scholars in particular have focused attention on the ideal of objectivity, and some have argued that scientific objectivity, with its emphasis on the detachment of the observer from the natural world, is a gender-linked ideal, reified by the image of the male scientist scrutinizing and even oppressing fe­ male nature.&#39; Consequently, feminist critics of science such as Donna Haraway</p>

<p>and Sandra Harding have advocated abandonment of the ideal of objectivity in fa­ vor of epistemologies that recognize the situated and fragmentary character of all knowledge.2</p>
<p>The feminist critique of objectivity rests heavily on the psychoanalytical perspec­ tive of Nancy Chodorow, who has argued that female and male children articulate their adolescent identity through fundamentally divergent responses to the maternal bond: To forge their identity as men, male children must detach themselves from their primary love-object, whereas female children forge their identities as women in continuing identification with their mothers. To the extent that children are raised primarily or exclusively by women, male identity is forged in separation, female identity in attachment. To the degree that primary gender identification resonates throughout other aspects of cognitive and emotional life, men may be more likely to view the world from the perspective of detachment, women from the perspective of connection. If Chodorow&#39;s exegesis is correct, then the articulation of nature through the lens of a fully detached observer is a gender-laden concept, at odds with the understanding of the world that females develop through their primary af­ fective experience. <em>3</em></p>
<p>Thus one explanation for women&#39;s invisibility in science might be that women</p>
<p>tend to do science in a less objective, i.e., less detached or more contextualized, manner than their male counterparts, and therefore have their work misinterpreted, undervalued, or harshly judged. This is the interpretation placed by Evelyn Fox Kel-</p>

By any account Harding&#39;s notion of &quot;strong objectivity&quot; is clearly not the same as a classical account of objectivity that presupposes an interchangeable knower; it more closely resembles Mannheim&#39;s perspectivalism (see Karl Mann­ heim, <em>Ideology and Utopia: An Introduction to the Sociology of Knowledge,</em> trans.

<p>OBJECTIVITY OR HEROISM?	89</p>
<p>ler on the life of Nobel-Prize-winning geneticist Barbara McClintock. In Keller&#39;s view, McClintock&#39;s colleagues mostly failed to understand her empathetic perspec­ tive-her &quot;feeling for the organism&quot;-resulting in highly delayed   recognition of her work. Some recent commentators have gone to considerable lengths to try to demonstrate that there is a female style of doing science, characterized by greater empathy, greater concern for context, or greater attention to the interconnectedness of natural phenomena-and thus potentially at odds with norms of scientific objec­ tivity.4 Insofar as scientific objectivity demands the effacement of the observer and insists on the irrelevance of context, it might not be surprising that women are rare and marginalized in science.</p>
<p>But if we look at the history of American women scientists in the twentieth cen­ tury, an apparent paradox emerges: The types of work that women have done in many branches of American science <em>fit</em> conventional notions of objectivity. Broad historical generalizations are risky but, if anything, it appears that women in Ameri­ can science have been characteristically employed not in jobs that required a high degree of emotional involvement or contextual judgment, but precisely the opposite. In the physical sciences in the first half of the twentieth century, women were rou­ tinely engaged in a wide variety of highly quantitative analytical and numerical work-a type of work that has often been portrayed as emblematic of scientific objectivity. The classification of stellar spectra for the Draper star catalog, the high­ precision calculations performed by women such as Maria Mitchell for the U.S. Nautical Almanac, the work of female computers at the U.S. Naval Observatory, the analysis of bathythermograph records at Wood&#39;s Hole Oceanographic Institution and Scripps Institution of Oceanography-all were highly objectified tasks, and some of this work led to important observational, theoretical, or methodological advances.5 If objectivity is the central requisite of science, why have these women not received greater recognition?</p>
<p>In focusing on objectivity, feminists are in concert with commentators past and</p>
<p>present, of both pro- and antiscience persuasions, who have characterized objectivity as the central ideal of the sciences.6 But <em>is</em> objectivity the central value of science?</p>

<p>Or, more to the point, is it the most significant value in understanding the situation of women in science? The thesis of this paper is that many women have done objective scientific work, but have had their work obscured or devalued by the ideology of scientific heroism-an ideology that has been particularly  manifest in the history of the field sciences. An example is Eleanor Lamson (1875-1932).</p>
<p><strong>ELEANOR LAMSON AND THE REDUCTION OF MARINE GRAVITY DATA</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, gravity measurements had been undertaken to determine the shape of the Earth. In the early twentieth century, American geophysicists realized that gravity measurements could also re­ veal information about the Earth&#39;s internal density distribution and thereby about the forces responsible for the Earth&#39;s structure. William Bowie at the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey began to use gravity measurements to develop a detailed model of the Earth. The theoretical interpretation of their data was hampered, however, by an absence of data from the ocean basins. Attempts to measure gravity at sea had invari­ ably failed due to disruption from wind and waves.7 With  three-quarters of the Earth&#39;s surface unexamined, theories deduced from gravity data remained funda­ mentally speculative.</p>
<p>In the early 1920s, a Dutch geodecist, Felix Vening Meinesz, developed a novel pendulum gravimeter with which he produced the first successful measurements of gravity at sea. Using his device aboard submarines, Vening-Meinesz could minimize the effect of surface accelerations to obtain highly reproducible results. His work caught the attention of William Bowie, who, in cooperation with the Carnegie Insti­ tution of Washington and the U.S. Navy, invited Vening Meinesz to come to the United States to measure gravity aboard  a U.S. Navy submarine. The results were the first North American measurements of gravity at sea, and would ultimately play an important role in overturning existing geological theory.8</p>
<p>On October 2, 1928, the U.S.S. <em>S-21</em> submarine steamed out of the U.S. Naval Yard in Hampton Roads, Virginia, with considerable fanfare and ceremony. Navy Secretary Curtis Wilbur was there for the send-off; his presence was recorded in the</p>

<p>ship&#39;s log, and formal portraits were taken before the ship sailed.9  Representing the Carnegie Institution was Frederick Wright, a petrologist at the Carnegie&#39;s Geophysi­ cal Laboratory. Upon completion of the cruise, the results were written up by Vening Meinesz and Wright as a publication of the U.S. Naval Observatory. Bowie, Vening Meinesz, and Wright were guests of honor at an official state dinner in Washington, and the cruise and the dinner were written up by Bowie for <em>Scientific American</em> magazine. Bowie was later authorized by a joint resolution of Congress to accept an award of the Order of Orange Nassau from the Queen of the Netherlands, and a medal was established in his honor by the American Geophysical Union.10 Vening Meinesz went on to win numerous scientific awards; Wright became secretary of the National Research Council. Not invited to the official state dinners, or featured in the official portrait, or mentioned in <em>Scientific American,</em> was the woman in charge of the data reductions: Eleanor Annie Lamson, associate astronomer at the U.S. Naval Observatory.</p>
<h1 id='a-scientist-or-a-technician'><strong><em>A Scientist or a Technician?</em></strong></h1>
<p>Lamson was the person responsible for developing and implementing the procedures necessary to convert the photographic records of the pendulum into measurements of the acceleration of gravity. In the language of Bruno Latour, she was the person responsible for converting instrumental inscriptions into scientific information; La­ tour and others have emphasized how nontrivial this conversion can be. Neverthe­ less, scientists normally make a strong distinction between themselves and their technicians, typically on the grounds of originality. If Lamson were a technician, following a procedure established by someone else, then her ellipsis from official recognition would have been routine-then as now.11 As one of the many women of various skill levels who worked at large observatories, Lamson belongs to a histori­ cally ambiguous category: Was she a scientist or a technician? We may consider her status on two levels, sociological and epistemic. Was she trained and recognized as a professional scientist, and did she make an intellectually original contribution to the <em>S-21</em> expedition?</p>
<p>Lamson&#39;s overall scientific stature was codified by her inclusion in the 1927 edi­ tion of <em>American Men of Science.</em> Her citation recognized her &quot;fundamental [work on] star catalogues and the orbits of comets and asteroids.&quot; This establishes her as a person deemed to be making substantive contributions to American science and as a professional woman who achieved an unusually high level of success. Born on April 19, 1875, in Washington, D.C., Lamson received her B.S. in mathematics and physics from George Washington University in 1897, and two years later her M.S. in astronomy. She thus embarked on her scientific career with similar qualifications to most of her male colleagues, but as a woman she labored under considerably</p>

<p>different professional conditions. Upon completion of her degree, she was appointed a &quot;piece-work&quot; computer at the U.S. Naval Observatory, a job that was held exclu­ sively by women. 12 In 1903, she became a full-time computer and four years later she was promoted to the position of assistant scientist, which she held for the next sixteen years. During this time, she rose through the ranks to become head of the Computing Section of the Observatory, but whereas all other division heads were principal astronomers (or, in some cases, military officers), and men, her title re­ mained fixed at the assistant-astronomer level.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1923, following the passage of the Civil Service Re­ classification Act, Lamson was required to complete a questionnaire documenting her job responsibilities. Many women&#39;s job titles were downgraded in the reclassifi­ cation effort, to justify their low pay, but for Lamson the Re-classification Act pro­ vided an opportunity to receive the promotion she had long been denied.13 Lamson&#39;s supervisors recommended an increase in her classification level on the basis of her scientific training and the independence and nonroutine nature of her work. They cited her &quot;[c]ollege training with degree from an institution of recognized standing [w]ith major work in mathematics, mechanics, astronomy,&quot; and her work, which involved &quot;performing ... with considerable latitude for individual judgment respon­ sible scientific work requiring extended training and considerable previous experi­ ence.&quot; 14 In other words, she did science. Her specific responsibilities included &quot;re­ duction of [observational] data, proof reading, computing orbits of asteroids and comets, instructing new computers, [and taking] part in discussion and preparation for publication of the observations.&quot; A particular issue in the reclassification effort was whether the employee worked under supervision or independently: Lamson, it was recorded, &quot;works to a large extent upon her own responsibility.&quot; This was an understatement: Since 1911 she had been responsible for the entire computing sec­ tion of the Observatory, supervising the work of eight assistant scientists and com­ puters, six women and two men.10</p>
<p>Promotion did not follow automatically. Initially, it was denied. A series of letters</p>
<p>followed, including one from Lamson to the chairman of the Personnel Classifica­ tion Board and one from her brother William, a former army officer, to Assistant Navy Secretary Theodore Roosevelt. In November 1923, Lamson&#39;s promotion was finally approved; the following summer, her annual salary was nearly doubled­ from $1,600 to $3,000. Yet her title remained fixed at the assistant scientist level. In 1925, Lamson was appointed a National Research Council Delegate to the Interna­ tional Astronomical Union and was finally given the title of associate scientist. At the time of her death on July 27, 1932, she was earning $3,500 per annum, a salary comparable to that received by senior male scientists at the observatory.16 In short, Eleanor Lamson was a scientist. She was trained as a scientist, she was recognized</p>

<p>as a scientist and, after considerable effort, she was paid as a scientist. Her opportu­ nities for advancement were circumscribed by her sex, but her supervisors and col­ leagues recognized her as a fellow professional. What then was her epistemic contri­ bution to the measurement of gravity at sea?</p>
<p>Lamson&#39;s contribution to the <em>S-21</em> expedition was to take the relatively well­ understood problem of terrestrial gravity reduction and develop it for the less well­ understood marine realm-a perfect case of Kuhnian normal science. The Coast Survey&#39;s techniques for the reduction of gravity data in the terrestrial realm were well established (albeit not uniformly accepted). They involved laborious calcula­ tions and, in some cases, arguable assumptions about the structure of the Earth&#39;s crust. When gravity measurement was extended in to the marine realm, the existing procedures had to be adapted to the task, and the embodied assumptions modified and justified for the specifics of the marine realm. Corrections were needed for the acceleration and depth of the submarine, height and density of the water column, and effect of temperature on water density, as well as standard corrections for the velocity of the Earth&#39;s rotation, the sidereal time relative to the base station in Wash­ ington, D.C., and the density of the Earth at that position. This required an under­ standing of the physics of the phenomena responsible for gravity and how they would be differentially affected by the specifics of the marine environment.</p>
<p>The results of Lamson&#39;s work were seven or eight pages of calculations for each of the expedition&#39;s fifty gravity stations. However, the calculations and their expla­</p>
<p>nation were not included in the body of the report of the expedition. They were published as an appendix. Just as women&#39;s work was organizationally and epistemi­ cally segregated at the U.S. Naval Observatory, Lamson&#39;s work was segregated in the observatory&#39;s report of the <em>S-21</em> expedition. Lamson&#39;s name appeared in small print on the front cover as the author of the &quot;Appendix on Computational Procedure&quot; (Figure 1). This appendix was the first published documentation of the calculational procedures required to reduce marine gravity data, and later publications on marine gravity work refer back to this work.17 But since Lamson was the author of the appen­ dix only and not of the report itself, citations invoke only the names ofVening Meinesz and Wright. A scientist or historian perusing the literature of this period would never know that a woman scientist had been involved in early gravity work at all.</p>
<p>The question might be posed, would a man have received more recognition for the same work? Or, put historically, did men doing the same kind of work receive a greater amount of credit? But this misses the point: A man would <em>not</em> have done the same work. In the first place, no two scientific research projects are ever precisely the same, so one can always look for, and find, distinctions that can be used to justify differential recognition. If a person is neglected historically, it is never possible to prove that the matter would have been different had she been a man, or had he been white, rich, or more powerful. In the second place, men in the 1920s <em>did not do this</em></p>
<p>17 In the preface to the <em>S-21</em> report, Naval Observatory Superintendent C. S. Freeman credits Lam­ son with &quot;check[ing} all computations in the report and prepar[ing) the appendix indicating the com­ puting methods employed.&quot; (Vening Meinesz and Wright, &quot;The Gravity Measuring Cruise,&quot; cit. n. 8). This illustrates how official representations of her work minimized her contributions relative to what was documented in internal (unpublished) records. F. A.

Eleanor Lamson interpreted the gravity data (mathemati­ cally), Frederick Wright interpreted her interpretation (verbally), and the work of the fonner became an appendix to the latter. The point here is <em>not</em> that Lamson would or should have received greater recognition for her work had she been a man, but rather that her ellipsis from recognition has nothing to do with objectivity.</p>
<p>In I929, Lamson was given the task of writing the discussion of the cruise for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey&#39;s Annual Report on Operations. Her summary includes an account of the theoretical logic behind the cruise comparable in detail and congruent in substance with the unpublished reports submitted by Fred Wright to the Carnegie Institution.18 This suggests that Lamson participated in scientific discussions surrounding the cruise, as indicated in her job description; at minimum, it demonstrates that she understood the theoretical problems represented by the ex­ pedition as fully as Wright and was trusted by Bowie to write them up. In the follow­ up to the <em>S-21</em> cruise, the <em>S-48</em> expedition of 1932, Lamson&#39;s death is noted as the cause of a delay in the completion of the data reductions and publication of the</p>

<p>scientific results; the supervision and correction of the data reductions was not taken on by one of her assistants, but was transferred to the Naval Hydrographic Office.19 Eleanor Lamson is not a forgotten genius-she is not a lost heroine of science.</p>
<p>Nor was she a technician. She was a scientist who played a part in the first U.S. submarine gravity measurements. She was acknowledged by her coworkers as a member of the scientific team that produced important new scientific data, at the forefront of geophysical science.20 But whereas the names of the men with whom she worked are well known to many scientists and historians of science, the name of Eleanor Lamson disappeared.</p>
<h1 id='public-glory-private-work'><strong><em>Public Glory, Private Work</em></strong></h1>
<p>Eleanor Lamson was acknowledged within the framework of technical discourse, but she disappeared in the public arena, where the work of the <em>S-21</em> expedition was presented as a heroic voyage of conquest. In private discourse, the principal argu­ ment made in favor of measuring gravity at sea was efficiency. On a practical level, the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey was a government agency that needed to show results. On a theoretical level, more data were critical to establishing the legitimacy of geological theories derived from geodetic data. Submarine work promised to be far more efficient than terrestrial work for two principal reasons. First, the ocean is a subhorizontal surface with little topography, and the underlying mass is of relatively constant density. Therefore, fewer simplifying assumptions are required to interpret gravity data at sea. Second, establishing stations at sea is merely a matter of sailing from one place to another. One is not restricted to existing roads or pathways, and the problems of leveling, finding an unimpeded line-of-sight, and moving men and equipment through forests filled with ticks, leeches, and snakes are removed. With the use of submarines to avoid surface disturbances, high-quality data could be col­ lected rapidly.</p>
<p>When William Bowie wrote to John Merriam, director of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, to secure the latter&#39;s financial support for the <em>S-21</em> expedition, his brief letter emphasized the promise of efficient data-gathering. Bowie recounted the number of measurements that Vening Meinesz had completed in his first Dutch expedition: &quot;In 29 days he made 55 determinations of gravity. This is a wonderful record.&quot; In his <em>Scientific American</em> article, Bowie declared the cruise a success be­ fore any of the data were actually analyzed, because of the <em>quantity</em> of data garnered; other accounts similarly stress quantitative productivity.21 In all the extant letters surrounding the <em>S-21</em> expedition, risk is not mentioned. Not one letter expresses concern for the safety of the scientists at sea or the risk of potential fatalities. The only hardship mentioned is boredom at sea, and the possible discomfort of life in</p>

<p>20 Others might also be considered  part of  the &quot;team&quot;  at some level-her assistants,  the sailors who sailed the submarine, etc. The point here is that Lamson was acknowledged as a scientist.

<p>cramped submarine quarters (a particular issue for the 6 foot 6 inch Vening Meinesz).</p>
<p>In contrast, the public account of gravity measurement portrayed a very different image. In the article written for <em>Scientific American,</em> issues of efficiency were cast aside in favor of the metaphor of conquest. Aided by pictures of submarines and military officers, Bowie painted a portrait of the <em>S-2</em> / expedition as a military mis­ sion to conquer the Earth&#39;s secrets and penetrate the depths of nature (in this case literally). He declared, &quot;The S-21 ... left the dock on the afternoon of October 2nd</p>
<p>... and headed toward the sea on a voyage to conquer the Earth&#39;s secrets.&quot; If the expedition were a voyage of conquest, then by implication the returning scientists were conquering heroes, qualified by their special talents and willingness to endure hardship in pursuit of their goal. Accordingly, Bowie emphasized that Vening Meinesz was uniquely qualified to undertake this expedition, as &quot;the only man in the world to design an apparatus for determining gravity at sea.&quot; Like Atlas, Vening Meinesz had encircled the Earth in his pursuit of gravity, in one case remaining at sea for two hundred days. Besides the general hardship of prolonged periods at sea, Bowie pointed out that in the Caribbean, where the <em>S-2</em> / sailed, the seas are &quot;un­ stable,&quot; earthquakes are common, and the waters are tremendously deep, falsely implying that the scientists aboard were in serious danger of being drowned or killed. But these scientists were also stoics, and although they experienced &quot;much buffeting by rough seas,&quot; they never complained, and on their arrival home, &quot;all on board were happy, although tired&#39;&#39; having participated in a &quot;splendid, epoch­ making expedition.&quot;n</p>
<p>Military metaphors and accounts of physical endurance were common throughout Coast and Geodetic Survey writings, reinforced by the Survey&#39;s naval connections. Stoicism was part of the ideology of the Survey, where men commonly endured harsh physical conditions while doing technical work. When Bowie&#39;s mentor John Hayford died in 1925, his efforts were recounted accordingly in a National Academy of Sciences Memoir: &quot;[Hayford&#39;s] work called for endurance of the most rugged of pioneers, the undaunted courage of the explorer, while the operations involved repre­ sent one of the highest types of work demanded from the scientist ... [His] descrip­ tions of this work [were] replete with tales of heroism and endurance of the men engaged upon it and would constitute an epic if but known to the world, but accepted by them as part of the day&#39;s work.&quot; <em>23</em></p>
<p>Bowie&#39;s popular article on the <em>S-21</em> expedition likewise emphasized the sacrifice rather than the reward of the marine work and the unique mix of strength, intelli­ gence, and perserverance of the individuals involved. But was Vening Meinesz really the &quot;only man in the world&quot; who could measure gravity at sea? Was the work unusu­ ally difficult or hard to reproduce? In their own account written for the Naval Obser­ vatory, Vening Meinesz and Wright suggested precisely the opposite. While Bowie was heralding Vening Meinesz&#39;s unique talents, the latter was concentrating on mak­ ing gravity work as routinized as possible to ensure the reproducibility of the results. Vening Meinesz wrote:</p>
<p><em>22</em> Bowie, &quot;Weighing the Earth&quot; (cit. n. 10), p. 220.</p>
<p>23 <strong>W. H.</strong> Burger, &quot;John Fillmore Hayford,&quot; <em>National Academy of Sciences Biographical  Memoir,</em></p>
<p>1936, <em>16:154-292,</em> on pp. 172-174.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVITY OR HEROlSM?	97</p>
<p>[T]he operation of the gravity apparatus is made as simple as possible so that the ob­ server makes each measurement almost mechanically, starts the apparatus, records the temperature, the barometric pressure, and so on, and has only to take care that no essen­ tial step is omitted. The single difficult task is the determination of the rates of the chronometers by comparison with the radio time signals. This operation, which is quite independent of the gravity measurements, requires a high degree of skill on the part of the observer. [But] it is possible that a method can be devised [in the future] for making this comparison mechanically with the aid of a radio set-up, thus eliminating the per­ sonal factor in the method.24</p>
<p>Properly designed, gravity measurement at sea was not difficult. It was mundane, and this was necessary to ensure reproducibility of the results. One <em>strove</em> for routin­ ization. The elimination of the personal was a requisite of scientific objectivity and contrasted squarely with the portrait of heroism painted by Bowie. The latter de­ manded uniqueness, the former demanded standardization. Adventure implies un­ certainty, but uncertainty is anathema to objectivity. Bowie&#39;s heroic image was constructed from a situation where uncertainty was in fact studiously minimized and the individual made to be as irrelevant as possible.</p>
<p>But if the work performed at sea was mundane-and all the available evidence suggests that it was-then this removes the frequently invoked distinction between men and women&#39;s scientific work: namely, that women&#39;s work was mundane (and therefore of little interest scientifically or historically). The distinction here appears to be one of image rather than of substance, of context rather than content. The marine work could be reconstructed as heroic given the potential (albeit unrealized) for danger in the context of the work. Mundane work undertaken in treacherous conditions can be heroic. But <em>was</em> gravity work dangerous? Did the scientists aboard the <em>S-21</em> worry about safety? Helen and Finley Wright, the children of Fred Wright, who traveled extensively as a geologist, recall that neither their father nor their mother worried particularly about this venture; the principal hardship recounted by their father was headache induced by diesel fumes. Vening Meinesz, they recall, liked American submarines better than Dutch ones, because he &quot;could stand erect in more than one place ... and they put an extension of his bunk so he would be more comfortable.&quot; The genre of adventure may have been useful to Bowie as a narrative strategy and helped to capture his audience&#39;s imagination, but it does not square with the reality of the work of the <em>S-21</em> expedition. In their final report, Ven­ ing Meinesz and Wright did alert their fellow scientists to one important discomfort at sea: &quot;An adequate supply of underwear should also be taken to provide for fre­ quent changes in the tropical humid zone.&quot;25</p>

Bowie&#39;s pictures of men aboard ships implicitly invoked the accomplishments of the great polar ex­ plorers of the previous decades, and the map of the world further emphasized the expeditionary aspects of the work (Figure 3).26 By invoking the aspects of adven­ ture-bravery, physical strength, danger-the scientists of  the  <em>S-21</em>  expedition could qualify for status as explorers, and therefore as public heroes. This was not a trivial accomplishment. In the late I 920s, Bowie&#39;s agency was under intense budget­ ary pressure and, acutely aware of the need for public support, Bowie wrote numer­ ous popular articles and radio addresses, commonly emphasizing the expeditionary aspects of Coast Survey work.27 The rhetoric and imagery of heroic adventure could</p>

<p>By the standards of mechanical or aperspectival objectivity, all of the scientists involved in the <em>S-21</em> expedition participated in objective scientific work: Felix Ven­ ing Meinesz and Frederick Wright photographed the period of a pendulum; Eleanor Lamson converted the photographic records into numbers. But only the men went to sea. Only the men&#39;s work could be cast as a heroic voyage to &quot;conquer the earth&#39;s secrets.&quot; Therefore only the men appeared in the public eye. Indeed. Wright was sent on the expedition <em>not</em> to make an original scientific contribution, but to learn the techniques of gravity measurement so that the Carnegie Institution could con­ tinue this work after Vening Meinesz had gone home. Yet Wright is featured in the photographs; Wright was invited to the official dinners. In the public domain, the fact of participating in the field expedition was more important than the specific</p>
<p>OBJECTIVITY OR HEROISM?	101</p>
<p>scientific work performed. But could Lamson have participated in the field work had she been so inclined? Had she been strong enough? Brave enough? Tough enough? No, women were not permitted aboard Navy submarines in the 1920s, nor are they today. The work of Eleanor Lamson was no less objective and possibly less mundane than the work of Felix Vening Meinesz and Frederick Wright. Eleanor Lamson satis­ fied the norms of scientific objectivity, but her work was rendered invisible by the rhetoric of heroism in the public sphere. By the standard of objectivity, Eleanor Lamson was a scientist, but by the standard of heroic conquest, she was not.</p>
<p>Peter Dear has argued that, in the emerging scientific traditions of the British Royal Society, the authority of the scientific witness was linked to the articulation of the circumstances under which the witnessing took place. One important detail was the experience and expertise of the observer. However, as the ideal of aperspec­ tival objectivity grew in the late nineteenth century, public representations of the unique skills of the scientist accordingly shrank.28 Then how could a scientist assert the authority of his witness? One way was to document the extremes to which he was willing to go to obtain scientific facts. As Bruce Hevly argues elsewhere in this volume, details of harsh observational circumstances could serve to establish the status of the observer as an exceptional man-even (or especially) if the observa­ tions could have in principle been made by someone else. The more extreme the conditions, the greater the man. Thus, to paraphrase Carolyn Jones in her discussion of the ideology of heroic individualism in modem art, the symbolism of heroism served to authenticate scientific discovery by demonstrating the unique qualities of the scientist.29</p>
<p>In the case of modern art in the early twentieth century, Jones has argued that the ideology of the heroic individual provided an informing backdrop for various forms of modernism by emphasizing the isolated artist alienated from life, culture, and family. Yet in reality, few of the modernists worked alone, and many male artists shared their studios with women, typically spouses or lovers who were also col­ leagues. Nevertheless, in photographs of these artists at work, the women either are not seen or are placed in the background as witnesses to, but not participants in, the creative act. In a telling footnote, Jones describes a museum that has been estab­ lished in the studio that Jackson Pollack shared with the painter Lee Krasner, also his wife. Pollack worked there for some twenty years, Krasner for thirty, but in the posthumous recreation of the studio Krasner&#39;s existence is &quot;documented by a small display of materials in an <em>outer</em> room.&quot; Krasner&#39;s real presence in the life of Jackson Pollack has been removed in the public reconstruction of that life.30 Likewise the reconstruction of the <em>S-21</em> expedition as a heroic voyage omitted Eleanor Lamson</p>

<p>102	NAOMI ORESKES</p>
<p>and contributed to her invisibility by denying her contributions in the public arena even  while they were acknowledged  in the private technical sphere. The imagery and rhetoric of expeditionary heroism in the field sciences has camouflaged women&#39;s contributions, by reinforcing an image associated with physicality, when in fact physicality often had nothing to do with the actual scientific work, and by relegating their contributions to the realm of the mundane, in spite of the reality that field work was commonly characterized more by boredom than excitement.</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVITY AND HEROISM: COMPETING VISIONS OF SCIENCE</strong></p>
<p>The modem scientific enterprise has been historically characterized by two compet­ ing and to some extent contradictory images. Most prevalent is the image of a hyper­ rational, dispassionate observer: a serious man in a white lab coat. He may be skinny, he probably wears glasses-he is an antihero of a sort-and his appearance suggests a slightly suspect masculinity: His life&#39;s work is mental, not physical. But a second conceptualization is also pervasive, if less readily conjured: the scientist as a heroic individual, dedicated to the quest for knowledge against the bulwarks of ignorance and the powers of darkness and superstition. He, too, believes in the powers of rea­ son, but his commitment to it is deeply passionate, and his actions may require great physicality. The image of a heroic competitor has played at least as important a role in science as that of the dispassionate observer. Yet the values that these two images represent and promulgate are not the same, nor are their implications for women. The first image is linked to the ideal of objectivity. The dispassionate dissector of nature is untainted by strong emotion. His white lab coat is a cipher for a bloodless rationality that permits the pursuit of nature with cold and abstract objectivity: The personal characteristics of the individual are subsumed behind his colorless cloak­ ing; the person within the coat is interchangeable; the work performed, fully re­ producible. His possibly suspect masculinity proves the irrelevance of emotional connections and physical attributes: His <em>brain</em> is his only essential organ. If we focus on this image, objectivity appears to be the central value of science and, at least in theory, anyone should be able to don the white coat. It is primarily a matter of <em>will­</em></p>
<p><em>ingness.</em> The interchangeable observer could in principle be a woman.</p>
<p>The image of the scientist engaged  in a heroic  quest is less obviously  connected to any particular scientific virtue, but more obviously related to images of successful masculinity in European culture. The heroic image conjures a vision of a man of great physical strength who, like the protagonists of Greek tragedy, is willing to sacrifice the emotional attachments of normal life and risk bodily harm for the sake of his quest. Above all, he is heroic in his dedication-in his willingness to sacrifice health, safety, or financial reward to achieve his goal. Although he is detached from the quotidian concerns of ordinary  mortals, this man is anything but dispassionate. As Evelyn Fox Keller and Sharon Traweek have emphasized, the quest itself is value-driven, deeply emotional, and contains a strong component of eroticism: The struggle to &quot;unveil the secrets&quot; and &quot;penetrate the depths&quot; of nature implies an activ­ ity suffused with male sexuality.11 The scientific hero is <em>not</em> interchangeable, and</p>

<p>OBJECTIVITY OR HEROISM?	103</p>
<p>not female. Thus, contrary to common belief, it may be the <em>passion</em> rather than the</p>
<p><em>dispassion</em> of science that is most threatened by femininity.</p>
<p>How do these two images fit together? Perhaps they don&#39;t. Heroism involves the glorification of the individual, objectivity demands his effacement. Thus the image of objectivity and the image of heroism play complementary roles and are useful in different contexts. Among scientific colleagues who share the value of objectivity­ but are nevertheless primed to challenge each other&#39;s results-a scientist may em­ phasize his dispassion to buttress his truth claims. Objectivity is an epistemological ideal, to which scientific colleagues can reasonably be assumed to subscribe. <strong>But it</strong> is also an isolating ideal, one that is not generally shared by the world at large. Thus it can be an alienating ideal, which separates the scientist from others from whom he may want or need support. Therefore, among a more diverse community the sci­ entist may emphasize his heroic virtues to appeal to larger community values. Theo­ dore Porter has suggested that the rhetoric and trappings of objectivity may be used to buttress a scientific community  against a hostile external community.32  This may be true if the status of the discipline as a science is disputed. But if the status of the discipline is secure, or if the outside community is perceived as potentially allied, then the heroic image can be invoked, and perhaps with greater effect. In the case of the <em>S-21</em> expedition, the dichotomy between public and private discourse clearly demonstrates that heroic ideology was considered useful or appropriate in the public realm. Heroic attributes and self-sacrifice make the scientist worthy of praise, admi­ ration, and support, and thus connect him as an individual to human ideals shared by a larger community. Heroism is an emotive ideal, which potentially connects science to all forms of intense human endeavor.</p>
<p>Heroism may also function as an internalized ideal, one that makes the scientific effort feel exciting, important, and valuable to the scientist himself.33 Heroic ideol­ ogy can transmogrify the mind-numbing tedium of daily scientific work into some­ thing glamorous and transcendental, and thus have a profoundly motivating power. What implications does this have for women in science? Unless an alternative ideol­ ogy is found, the female scientist is denied a connection to the community at large and denied a potentially important internal motivation as well.</p>
<h1 id='men-women-and-objectivity'><strong><em>Men, Women, and Objectivity</em></strong></h1>
<p>For centuries, men have argued that women are not at the forefront of science be­ cause they lack the necessary objectivity. A classic example of this attitude has been cited by Margaret Rossiter, from a <em>New York Times</em> editorialist considering Marie Curie&#39;s widely publicized visit to the United States in 1921. The anonymous editori­ alist wrote that there would always be more men than women in science because more men have &quot;the power-a necessary qualification for any real achievement in science-of viewing facts abstractly rather than relationally.&quot; Perhaps ironically, many feminists are now arguing more or less the same point, and responding by advocating relational, wholist, or contextual  thinking.34 But this is the intellectual</p>

<p>equivalent of high-low  poker: it accepts the game as fixed, even as it inverts the rules. But is the game fixed?</p>
<p>In her study of physicists engaged in high-energy particle research in the United States and Japan, Sharon Traweek found that American physicists believed that women did not succeed in physics because they were not individualistic enough, while Japanese physicists believed that women did not succeed because they did not know how to be part of a team.35 The cultural expectations of masculinity and femininity, and their relation to perceived or imagined scientific virtues, are different in these two national groups even though they self-identify as part of the same scien­ tific research community. What is cast as essential by one group is opposite to what is cast as essential by the other-and in both cases women are deemed deficient. Yet these groups are doing essentially the same science. The ideology of science bears a stronger relation to the belief structure of the scientific community than to the nature of the scientific work itself. Ideology and rhetoric both reflect and create the differential status of different kinds of scientific work, but neither the ideology, nor the rhetoric, nor the valuations are intrinsic to the work itself. At any given time and place, different elements of scientific ideology may function to exclude or camouflage the contributions of women scientists. The channeling of women scien­ tists into calculational work at large observatories suggests that in the early twentieth century the ideals of heroism were more central to the ideology and self-image of American geophysical science than were the ideals of objectivity.</p>
<p>Heroic rhetoric has been sharply manifested in the field-based sciences, with their historic connections to and overtones of expeditions and voyages of discovery. But heroic ideology exists in the laboratory-based sciences as well and invariably in­ vokes the implication of risked bodily harm. Every physicist has heard the apoc­ ryphal story of the graduate student who braved an explosion and fire at the now-defunct Cambridge Electron Accelerator to salvage his data, only to be blown out the door, &quot;data in hand,&quot; as the pressurized tanks exploded again.36 Every chemist has heard colleagues parade cavalier attitudes toward dangerous chemicals; every medical student has heard professors disdain protective equipment or boast about how many patients they see on how few hours sleep. Even mathematics, the most cerebral of the sciences, is infused with the ideology of physical danger and self­ sacrifice: In the early twentieth century, one prominent mathematician explicitly compared the pursuit of mathematical truth with the pursuit  of  alpine heights: &quot;Many times a scientific truth is placed as it were on a lofty peak, and to reach it we have at our disposal at first only hard paths along  perilous slopes  whence it is easy to fall into the abysses where dwells error; only after we have reached the peak by these paths is it possible to lay out safe roads which lead there without peril.&quot; 37 The choice of the alpine metaphor suggests that, appearances to the contrary, the</p>

<p>OBJECTIVITY OR HEROISM?	105</p>
<p>mathematician is maneuvering through dangerous territory, and therefore worthy of heroic stature. But although the risks taken by mathematicians are largely metaphor­ ical and those taken by geologists and chemists mostly exaggerated, one group of scientists have taken self-sacrifice literally: those who have engaged in auto­ experimentation. In the most extreme manifestation of heroic ideology, a number of individuals have made their bodies into their exploratory territory.</p>
<p><strong>THE BODY AS EXPLORATORY TERRITORY: AUTO-EXPERIMENTATION AS HEROIC TRADITION</strong></p>
<p>The history of biology and medicine is filled with stories, both documented and apocryphal, of physician-investigators who risked their lives through auto­ experimentation and became immortalized. There is the case of the Dutch surgeon who performed the world&#39;s first known cholecystectomy, sans anesthetic, on himself: His gallstones are enshrined in the museum of the Department of Pathology in Leiden.38 The enlarged heart of John Hunter, who infected himself with venereal disease to study its progress, was preserved in a jar for centuries. Daniel Carrion, credited with solving the problem of Peruvian Oroya fever, is memorialized in stat­ ues at the medical school in Lima that bears his name, and the name of Walter Reed, inaccurately credited with infecting himself with yellow fever, lives on every time a president of the United States visits the doctor.39</p>
<p>One of the best-documented cases of auto-experimentation involves Dr. Max von Pettenkofer (1818-190 l ), the German public health pioneer who debated with Rob­ ert Koch over the cause of cholera. In the wake of the epidemic that devastated Munich in 1854, Pettenkofer carefully studied the distribution of cholera mortality and discovered that low-lying and marshy areas were by far the hardest hit. He con­ cluded that the disease was caused by poisons produced by the interaction of air with decaying substances in the subsurface. Pettenkofer became an early advocate of sanitary water facilities and pioneered Munich&#39;s first public water supply. How­ ever, in 1884, against Pettenkofer&#39;s theory, Robert Koch identified the <em>Vibrio chol­ erae</em> bacillus in the blood of individuals dead from the disease.40</p>
<p>Pettenkofer refused to believe that an organism alone could cause cholera. If it did, why did some individuals in a household contract the disease and others not? Why did the poor suffer disproportionately? Why did cholera strike certain poor districts and not others? In an attempt to demonstrate that the disease was caused by the interaction of Koch&#39;s pathogen with soil and groundwater chemistry and not by the microbe alone, Pettenkofer ingested a laboratory culture of cholera bacillis, estimated to contain over one billion active pathogens. He performed the experiment in front of his students, invoking the metaphor of military service and self-sacrifice: &quot;Even if I be mistaken and this experiment that I am making imperils my life, I shall look death quietly in the face, for what I am doing is no frivolous or cowardly act</p>

<p>of suicide, but I shall die in the service of science as a soldier perishes on the field of honor. ... Man, who wants to occupy a higher position than the beasts, must be ready to sacrifice even life and health on behalf of higher and more ideal goods!&quot;41 The results of Pettenkofer&#39;s  heroic  self-sacrifice were  unheroically  inconclusive: He did not contract the disease, although he did experience abdominal pain and diarrhea, and large quantities of bacillus were found in his stool. Subsequently, Pet­ tenkofer&#39;s assistant and several of his students ingested live cultures with similar results. In principle, their actions should have posed a dilemma for the germ theo­ rists; in practice they had little impact. Pettenkofer&#39;s survival was dismissed as luck, or perhaps the result of some sort of resistance engendered by long-term contact with the disease. The problem of why some exposed individuals sickened and died, while others did  not, remained unresolved. Nevertheless, the story lives on, and Pettenkofer is now best known for his auto-experiment, rather than for his lasting</p>
<p>contributions to public health.</p>
<p>Was Pettenkofer a scientific hero or an old fool who knowingly endangered him­ self and his associates? In a recent portrayal of this historical incident by a leading medical writer, Pettenkofer and his colleagues are criticized &quot;not because [the exper­ iments] were done on themselves, but because parts of their theory ...  were wrong and because they did not accumulate enough data on a sufficient number of volun­ teers.&quot;&quot;2 In this view, Pettenkofer&#39;s error was not in the self-aggrandizing act of auto­ experimentation, or in  the ethical ambiguity of encouraging students to endanger their lives, but in the methodologically inconclusive nature of the experiments.</p>
<p>The auto-experiments of Daniel Carrion were conclusive-fatally so. Carrion injected himself with the blood of a boy suffering from a common <strong>skin</strong> ailment, verruga peruana, to study the progress of the disease. Three weeks later, Carrion developed a fatal case of Oroya fever, inadvertently discovering that the two afflic­ tions were in fact the same disease and proving that one bacteria could cause two (apparently) different diseases. Although  a murder charge was considered  against the colleague who assisted him, Carrion did not intend to kill himself; verruga peru­ ana was an ugly, painful disease, but rarely fatal. Yet popular accounts apocryphally credit him with conscious  willingness to sacrifice himself  in the name of science and country: &#39;Tm not frightened by the skin deformities, and if the disease develops so seriously that it affects a vital organ, I&#39;m ready to pay with my life.&quot;41</p>
<p>Pettenkofer could be accused of stupidity and Carrion of naivete, but often the auto-experimenter is portrayed as smarter than those surrounding him, possessed of an emboldening insight lacking in his colleagues. Biologists recount with pleasure the story of Lem Cleaveland, the Harvard researcher who imported prohibited para­ sites for his research by infecting himself, or the case of Werner Forssman, who broke into locked cabinets to steal the equipment needed  to catheterize his own heart, and later won the Nobel Prize for it. Another example is Beppino Giovanelli, who discovered that thymidine. a component  of  DNA, could shrink cancer tumors in mice, and tested it on himself to force the U.S. Food and Drug Administration</p>
<p>41 Wieninger, <em>Max Von Pettenkofer</em> (cit. n. 40), pp. 176-178. A Viennese colleague of mine recalls being told about Pettenkofer and other heroes of science in school and, concluding that you had to be willing to ingest pus or walk through sewers to be a scientist, she pursued her studies in foreign languages instead.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVITY OR HEROISM?	107</p>
<p>into immediate human experimental trials. Thymidine proved to be ineffective in humans; nevertheless, Giovanelli is portrayed as a hero for his defiance of bureau­ cratic regulation. As two recent writers have put it, &quot;The modem scientist, frustrated by the elaborate rules of the multi-layered science and health bureaucracy, often experiments on himself simply to avoid having to waste time dickering with his human experimentation committee.&quot;44 In the extreme, commentators view the auto­ experimenter as a kind of scientific superman, whose unique insight permits him to break rules imposed by and for ordinary mortals. The act of self-sacrifice demon­ strates an ultimate dedication to the search for knowledge. But whereas the field scientist risks possible harm from the external world, the auto-experimenter goes further and internalizes the danger in his very body.</p>
<p>The British geneticist J.B. S. Haldane considered death in a well constructed auto-experiment &quot;the ideal way .of dying.&quot; Haldane&#39;s father, the physiologist John Scott Haldane, engaged in a lifetime of auto-experimentation on diverse subjects related to the limits of human endurance and occupational health. Among other things, the elder Haldane inhaled carbon monoxide in the aftermath of coal mine explosions and subsequently demonstrated the value of canaries in detecting bad mine air.45 It was said that he could &quot;stand dry air to about three hundred degrees Fahrenheit, but if he moved about too much his hair began to singe.&quot; The younger Haldane-who on occasion participated in his father&#39;s work-invoked military her­ oism to describe his father&#39;s attitude toward his science: &quot;[My father was] like a good soldier who will risk his life and endure wounds in order to gain victory. [H]e did not seek pain in his work, but [was] sufficiently interested in the work to ignore pain or fear.&quot;46</p>
<p>But is self-experimentation rational? Does it prove anything scientifically? Histo­ rians, philosophers, and sociologists have amply demonstrated that a single instance of refutation never overturns a strongly held theory, and a single instance of confir­ mation never establishes a new one. Instances of self-experimentation have certainly led to significant insight or stimulated more extensive research efforts, but the epis­ temological value of most auto-experiments-typically performed once or twice by a single individual-is certainly questionable.47 Some self-experiments have led to</p>

<p>46 Altman, <em>Who Goes First?</em> (cit. n. 39), pp. 223, 215.</p>
<p>47 A rare example of someone who has engaged in repeated auto-experiments is John Stapp, the surgeon credited with demonstrating the value of seat belts. As a U.S. Air Force officer responsible for improving the design of safety harnesses, he engaged in repeated crash tests with himself as &quot;dummy.&quot; His own accounts of his work are notably dispassionate, and his arguments for using himself in crash tests quite mundane: &quot;You can design  harnesses and restraints that are far better after you ride with one of your mistakes&quot; (Altman, <em>Who Goes First&quot;</em> (cit. n. 39), p. 31 ). Stapp took extensive precautions to minimize risk, used humans only after experiments had been made with dummies or animals, never ran an experiment on a Monday or Friday, and only married after he terminated this line of research <em>(ibid.,</em> pp. 29-32). Unlike Carrion, who purportedly welcomed death, Stapp is quoted as &quot;devoutly wish[ing] that I would outlive any experiment by at least six months so [as not tol cast aspersions on the research&quot; <em>(ibid.,</em> p. 32). Not surprisingly, Stapp is not an American national hero. Few persons outside of the military or Detroit have heard of him.</p>
<p>The most famous scientist to injure himself while undertaking scientific investigations is Isaac Newton, who damaged his eyes during observations of the sun. After looking directly at the sun as part of his experiments with color and vision, Newton suffered afterimages that lasted for days and that could be made to return on the thought of it for months after. Newton&#39;s conclusion, recounted to</p>

<p>considerable harm, such as the case of &quot;attenuated&quot; poliomyelitis vaccine, which was administered to thousands of American children in the 1930s after having been tested by its developer, John Kolmer, on himself, his assistant, and his two sons. The live vaccine resulted in numerous polio cases and at least five deaths.48 So why self­ experiment? The motivation clearly transcends the potential epistemic gain. The motivation is also in part emotive. The self-experiment demonstrates the willingness of the experimenter to risk personal harm in the name of science, and thus to qualify for heroic status. By making his body into his physical territory-and risking death-the self-experimenter casts himself as a heroic explorer into uncharted do­ mams.</p>
<p>As Jennifer Tucker points out elsewhere in this volume, the meteorologist James Glaisher became both a scientific and public hero just when he risked his life, and almost died, in his aerial ascents. The auto-experimenter gains stature precisely be­ cause of the potential for bodily harm. The inherent contradiction, as Tucker notes in her discussion of Glaisher, is that the element of danger that makes for heroics also potentially undermines the scientific credibility of the work. To legitimate the adventure, the danger must remain (or be perceived to be) at least in part uncon­ trolled. Yet this lack of control potentially undermines the reproducibility, and thus the perceived objectivity and value, of the work performed. The ideals of objectivity and the ideals of heroism do not entirely mesh. The value of self-sacrifice is ideolog­ ical, not epistemological.</p>
<p>The ideological import of self-experimentation is most clearly demonstrated by the case of Walter Reed, the army physician whose research team in Cuba in 1900 proved, by exposing human volunteers, that yellow fever was transmitted by mosqui­ toes. Having devastated French workers in the first effort to build a Panama Canal, yellow fever was impeding American imperial aspirations as well as threatening military public health. Reed&#39;s accomplishment was popularized in novels and films, and Reed was immortalized as a medical hero.49 A significant part of this immortali­ zation was the subsequently disproved myth that Reed had exposed himself to yel­ low fever. In some fictionalized accounts, Reed even died of the disease. (He died in 1902 from appendicitis.) But why should it matter whether Reed actually exposed himself to yellow fever? He led the team that solved a major public health problem, a tremendous scientific and administrative accomplishment. Evidently, heroic status required more: Reed had to have been prepared to expose himself to the same dan­ gers as his men, and to have been willing-like Pettenkofer, Carrion, and Haldane, like foot soldiers on the battlefield-to sacrifice his own life in the line of duty. Self­ sacrifice is essential to the ideology of heroic individualism in science, an ideology that portrays science as a &quot;war against ignorance that spends most of its time bogged down in confusion and procedure ... and then surges dramatically ahead as a result</p>
<p>John Locke, was that his activities had been foolish and undermined his ability to do further objective scientific work on the topic (H. W. Turnball, <em>The Correspondence of Isaac Newton</em> [Cambridge: Cam­ bridge Univ. Press, 1961], pp. 153-154).</p>
<p>48 Altman, <em>Who Goes First?</em> (cit. n. 39), p. 127.</p>
<p>49 The most famous popular account is the 1938 MGM film, <em>Yellow Jack.</em> Reed is portrayed as an extremely calm and steadfast scientist, determined to find the cause of the fever in spite of opposition from his superior officers, who accuse him of interfering with and undermining their authority, and his men, who repeatedly tell him it is a hopeless cause.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVITY  OR HEROISM?	109</p>
<p>of individual human vision, faith, and courage. No one illustrates this truth more dramatically than the scientist who wagers his life on the correctness of his the­ ory.&quot; 5° The body as &quot;field site&quot; is the ultimate heroic tale, in which the scientist potentially risks everything by engaging a battle against nature on his own internal territory. As Hamlet played out his struggle within his own psyche, so the auto­ experimenter engages his battle within his own body. The persistent theme of mili­ tary sacrifice reveals both the heroic aspiration and the incongruence of a vision of women on the battlefield.</p>
<p><strong>CAN&#39;T WOMEN BE HEROES?</strong></p>
<p>Although the word <em>objectivity</em> implies masculinity to many observers, it is not lin­ guistically gender-linked. The word <em>hero</em> is. As Douglas Hofstadter has emphasized, a hero and a heroine are simply not the same thing. Our language does not contain the word <em>heroinic;</em> we have no <em>heroinic</em> struggles.51 Predictably, virtually all the published (and apocryphal) accounts of self-experimentation are about men. In his detailed book on auto-experimentation, Lawrence K. Altman provides only two ex­ amples of auto-experimentation by women, and in both cases casts their contribu­ tions as acts of labor or love, rather than heroic bravery. One is Dr. Elsie Widdowson, who pioneered accurate measurement of nutrient contents of foods. Along with her research partner Dr. Robert McCance-a student of J.B. S. Haldane-Widdowson engaged in a lifetime of auto-experiments to determine human nutrient requirements and the effects of nutrient imbalances, in some cases at considerable risk. Perhaps her most socially important contribution was the determination of minimum nutrient requirements as guidelines for wartime ration allowances imposed by the British government during World War II, work that was considered top secret. But in Alt­ man&#39;s account, Widdowson is cast not as a war hero, but as a steady investigator whose work was &quot;more laborious than heroic, more grueling than dramatic.&quot; Alt­ man&#39;s second example is Mary Goldberger, who volunteered to be injected with the blood of a woman dying from pellegra to confirm her husband&#39;s belief that the dis­ ease was a nutritional deficiency, and not infectious. According to Altman&#39;s account, Goldberger declared, &quot;This was an act of faith; it took no courage.&quot; In this represen­ tation, hers was not the act of a hero(ine) willing to risk personal harm in the name of science, but of a loyal wife unquestionably believing the veracity of her hus­ band&#39;s work.52</p>
<p>Altman attributes the lack of stories about women mostly to statistics, because until recently few women have been medical researchers. Nevertheless, he adds that</p>

Hofstadter, &quot;Sexist Language: Just the Tip of a Cognitive Iceberg,&quot; <em>Iris: A Journal About Women,</em> 1986, /6:24-28. <em>Webster&#39;s</em> confirms Hofstader&#39;s insight: A hero is a &quot;mythological or legendary figure often of divine descent endowed with great strength or ability; an illustrious warrior; a man admired and emulated for his achievements and qualities.&quot; A heroine is derivative, not descended from the gods, but merely &quot;having the qualities of a hero.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;female medical researchers could, however, be taking an undue risk if they experi­ mented on themselves during pregnancy or at a time when they might become preg­ nant. It could be foolish for a woman of reproductive age to jeopardize her own health and the well-being of an unborn child by doing an experiment on herself.&quot; 53 But if self-sacrifice is the ultimate way of serving humanity, then women-who would be foolish or irresponsible to endanger their unborn children-are denied the opportunity to engage in the most important scientific work. Women are relegated to the inconsequential.</p>
<p>The virtual impossibility of creating a sustainable female image of scientific hero­ ism is demonstrated by the case of Marie Curie. Virtually the only generally known female scientist, Curie overcame poverty and discrimination to pursue a life of sci­ ence and win two Nobel prizes.54   Curie engaged in a highly physical struggle to isolate radium and did in fact sacrifice her life to science, succumbing to cancer induced by radiation exposure. Yet as Helena Pycior has recently emphasized, in the persona of Curie the narrative conventions of heroism came out all wrong: Her biographers generally cast her as a drudge rather than an Achilles, her physical exer­ tions closer to those of a charwoman than a superman.55   Stephen Brush has noted that popular science books &quot;make [her scientific work] sound like the worst form of drudgery: slaving over hot vats for four years,&quot; like a kind of tedious cookery. Even professional historians of science have perpetuated the notion of Curie&#39;s style as &quot;dogged [and] plodding.&quot; But was her work really more tedious than that of many other scientists? Was it more tedious than the work done by Vening Meinesz and Fred Wright aboard the <em>S-21?</em> Imagine for a moment if Vening Meinesz had been a woman, and see how easy it becomes to recast his work as, day after day, in a cramped and fetid submarine, looking out over dull gray seas, she carefully and laboriously measures the period of a pendulum and duly records the results 56</p>

Women geographers might seem the best candidates for scientific heroism, given that many of them did encounter physical danger in the course of their explorations. However, the history of scientific geography suggests that for women to be accepted in the professional community, they had to suspend all ordinary expectations of feminine behavior and appearance. If they did, then they might be treated by their (male) colleagues as &quot;honorary men,&quot; but this process of course undermined them as <em>female</em> heroes, while their general exclusion from scien­ tific societies such as the Royal Geographic undermined their position as <em>scientific</em> heroes. Indeed, in at least one documented instance, a woman geographer referred to herself as a man. See Mona Domosh, &quot;Toward a Feminist Historiography of Geography,&quot; <em>Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers,</em> 1991, <strong>N.S.,</strong> <em>16:95-104,</em> 484-490.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVITY OR HEROISM?	111</p>
<p><em>Being a Scientist,</em> begins not with a discussion of objectivity, but with the following story of discovery:</p>
<p>Tracy Sonneborn, 32-year-old biologist at Johns Hopkins University, was working late into the night. Looking through the eyepiece [of his microscope], he witnessed for</p>
<p>the first time what he would later call a &quot;spectacular&quot; reaction: the paramecia had clus­ tered into large clumps and were conjugating. In a state of delirious excitement, Sonne­ born raced through the halls of the deserted building looking for someone with whom he could share his joy. Finally he dragged a puzzled custodian back to the laboratory to peer through the microscope and witness this marvelous phenomenon.57</p>
<p>Of all possible stories of scientific discovery, why did the National Academy choose this one? Why is it relevant that there was no one around to see Sonnebom&#39;s discovery except the janitor? The cliche of midnight discovery is a cliche of heroic dedication: a testimony to the scientist&#39;s self-sacrificial willingness to continue to work long after lesser individuals have gone home. The story is a motivational tale, designed to encourage the right people to join the quest. Margaret Rossiter has pointed out that  the entire genre of advice books to young scientists is based  upon the advice that &quot;the one true path to advancement in science is through long uninter­ rupted hours of concentrated work.&quot; Midnight is the hour of uninterrupted work. But if the scientist  in the story were a woman, with children  alone at home, would we still admire her dedication? Would the story work?58 By emphasizing attributes asso­ ciated with masculinity, heroic ideology renders the female scientist invisible. By emphasizing activities that might be considered irresponsible if undertaken by a woman, heroic ideology relegates women&#39;s work to the realm of the inconsequential. The marginalization of women in science is a predictable consequence of heroic rhetoric, irrespective of whether the individuals invoking that rhetoric are con­ sciously sexist or not.</p>
<p>The story of Tracy Sonneborn encapsulates a second implicit message-that sci­ ence is done in solitude. In fact, modern science is anything but a solitary enterprise, yet the image of science as an individual pursuit persists with tremendous potency. The implication is that, no matter how large the laboratory, breakthroughs are made by individuals, because the scientist whose dedication drives him to persist where others have given up necessarily ends up alone. Implicitly, he has foresworn his familial and other personal attachments. Like the eponymous hero of Sinclair Lew­ is&#39;s Pulitzer-Prize-winning novel of the 1920s, <em>Arrowsmith,</em> who abandons his wife and child to pursue science in the woods of Vermont with a sole male colleague, the true scientist must sacrifice the emotional attachments of ordinary life in the pursuit</p>
<p>&#39;7 F. Ayala, et al., <em>On Being a Scientist</em> (Washington, D.C.: National Academy of Sciences Press, 1989), p. 1. A virtually identical opening line is found in the <em>Reader&#39;s Digest</em> account of Barry Mar­ shall, the Australian physican who recently demonstrated the role of infection in ulcers, in part by ingesting a concentrated dose of bacteria: &quot;As the hands of the wall clock edged towards midnight, Barry Marshall rubbed his eyes and placed a slide under the microscope       &quot;(Suzanne Chazin, &quot;The</p>
<p>Doctor Who Wouldn&#39;t Accept No,&quot; <em>Reader&#39;s Digest,</em> 1993 [October], <em>143:</em>199-224, on p. 199). It is stunning how this particular narrative structure transcends the class distance represented by the Na­ tional Academy of Sciences and the <em>Reader&#39;s Digest.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Rossiter, <em>Women Scientists</em> (cit. n. I), p. xi. One former scientist, now an industry executive, writing on why science is good preparation for the corporate world, explicitly substitutes the care of his instrument for the care of children: &quot;J can  well  remember  sitting  up  until 3 A.M.  babysitting our precious high-flux beam reactor through an experiment. The hours didn&#39;t matter &quot;(Michael</p>

<p>of knowledge. But if Martin Arrowsmith were a woman, would she-could she­ have abandoned her child?59</p>
<p>The rhetoric of solitude is linked to the image of objectivity: The scientist&#39;s intel­ lectual detachment is mirrored in his physical isolation. But perhaps too readily accepting this imagery, feminist critics have interpreted objectivity as an attribute of the individual-hence one that might be more or less present according to gender identity. But should objectivity be interpreted as an individual attribute? Most histo­ rians and sociologists of science have thought not. Both classic commentators such as Merton, Conant, and Polanyi, and recent feminist defenders of objectivity such as Helen Longino, have rejected the notion of <em>individual</em> objectivity and considered aperspectival knowledge to be a social achievement, attributable to the public na­ ture of scientific discourse. In the aftermath of the Manhattan Project-perhaps the ultimate example of communal science-James Conant argued that scientific objec­ tivity arises not so much from the habits or qualities of individuals as from the communal structure of laboratories and scientific societies, which so effectively en­ force impartiality as to render it &quot;automatic.&quot; Equating objectivity with impartiality, Conant argued along essentially Baconian lines that anyone who agreed to partici­ pate in the scientific community would necessarily produce objective scientific results:</p>
<p>Would it be too much to say that in the natural sciences today the given social environ­ ment has made it very easy for even an emotionally unstable person to be exact and impartial in his laboratory? The tradition he inherits, his instruments, the high degree of specialization, the crowd of witnesses that surrounds him, so to speak (if he publishes his results)-these all exert pressures that make impartiality on matters of his science almost automatic.60</p>
<p>Conant believed that the moment a scientist stepped outside of this protective structure, he would be just as susceptible to prejudice and error as anyone else. In contrast, Robert Merton felt that the dynamics of the scientific community were so effectively internalized by the scientist as to fashion &quot;his conscience ... his super­ ego,&quot; so that the habits of objective inquiry transferred to other aspects of life. More recently, Martin Rudwick has argued that through the agonistic interaction of scien­ tific competitors, the possible representations of nature are constrained, and a reli­ able picture may emerge. Aperspectival knowledge, then, is achieved through the dynamics of the scientific community-through scientific debate, peer review, pub­ lication, and, as Sharon Traweek has called it, the general &quot;collective surveillance&quot;</p>

Press, 1961 ); and Susan Lederer, &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; (film review), <em>Isis,</em> 1993, <em>84:771-772.</em> Charles Rosenberg, in his classic essay, scarcely mentions Arrowsmith&#39;s familial relations. Indeed, in both the novel and in Rosenberg&#39;s essay, Arrowsmith&#39;s sacrifice is couched primarily in terms of fame and wealth; he is <em>willing</em> to sacrifice the gifts of society; the abandonment of his son is an unintended (and not particularly significant) consequence. Joyce Arrowsmith is implicitly left to deal with the child-raising but, by making her independently wealthy, Lewis can cast Martin&#39;s sacrifice as noble (willing to forego wealth) rather than irresponsible (leaving his wife and child to starve). Strikingly, in the film version, there is no second marriage or child; apparently Hollywood judged that abandoning one&#39;s child would not be considered heroic by most moviegoers.</p>

<p>OBJECTIVITY OR HEROISM?	113</p>
<p>of the scientific community.61 On all these accounts, the scientist should be inter­ changeable. The community dynamics-not the attributes of the individual-are what count. But the case of Eleanor Lamson demonstrates that women can do highly objectified work-work that satisfies the collective standards of their own scientific community-yet have it rendered invisible by the rhetoric of heroism in the public sphere.</p>
<p>Quantification is often considered emblematic of scientific objectivity, but in the early twentieth century, calculation was considered women&#39;s work. If objectivity is a defining ideal of a scientific community, then these women&#39;s work should have been fully recognized. But if heroism is a defining ideal, then calculational work is quickly reduced to the routine. The channeling of women into calculational work suggests that heroism, rather than objectivity, was a central defining virtue for many American scientists in the early twentieth century. To dismiss women&#39;s work at the observatories as &quot;routine&quot; is implicitly to accept this prioritization.</p>
<p>Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison have argued that the ideal of objectivity was promulgated not merely as an epistemic ideal, but a moral ideal. Referring to scien­ tists in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, they write, &quot;there [was] a certain nobility in the abandonment of the personal, a sacrifice of the self for the collective</p>
<p>... comprehension.&quot; Aperspectival objectivity attested to the moral character of the scientist involved through his self-denial and willingness to forgo both personal per­ spective and personal credit.62 Objectivity was a form of self-sacrifice-no less than exposing oneself to a deadly disease-and defined primarily in <em>negative</em> terms: the sacrifice of personal hopes, the relinquishing of personal preferences, the abandon­ ment of expectation. The struggle with inward temptation-to see the world as one wanted it to be, rather than as it was-required &quot;heroic self-discipline.&quot;63 Perhaps the problem of objectivity in science should be reinterpreted as a subset of a larger and more embracing problem of scientific heroism.</p>
