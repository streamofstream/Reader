<p>Sit  in  a  circle.  Assemble  a  kit  composed  of  mirror,  light, and plastic speculum for each participant. Lubricate your speculum with the duckbill closed and the handle in the upward position. Insert with care. Squeeze the handle and press down. You will hear a click to let you know it is locked open. To see yourself, hold the mirror between your legs and direct the light toward it. The light will reflect off the mirror into your vagina so that your cervix will pop into view. Enjoy the lush color, texture, odor, and shape of the cervix and vaginal walls. Take turns sharing your observations with the group. Admire the subtle variations and the fine differences in form. Track changes.</p>
<p>These are some of the ingredients making up the feminist protocol of vaginal self-exam in Los Angeles in the 1970s. This assemblage of com- mercially available devices, behavioral scripts, affective economies, and embodied subjects became feminist self help’s iconic practice. Beyond a health care protocol, I want to argue, vaginal self-exam exemplified a his- torically particular and politically charged refashioning of <em>objectivity</em>. At stake in the protocol of vaginal self-exam was how to see and to create knowledge about health and bodies. In other words, vaginal self-exam made manifest the epistemological stakes—the politics of how-to-know—crafted into the biopolitical project of feminist self help. Moreover, feminist self- help practitioners argued that embodied ways of knowing produced better</p>

<p>knowledge. While historians of science tend to look to professionalized disciplines—physics, biology, astronomy, statistics—or increasingly to high-tech domains—such as genetics and nanotechnology—to histori- cize modes of objectivity, this chapter takes up the practice of vaginal self-exam to draw attention to how the history of objectivity in the late twentieth century was also crafted through politicized interruptions by nonprofessionals and, more specifically, by lay researchers who situated themselves as the embodied “subjects” and “objects” of technoscience. [. . .] As an attempt to practice research as a political project that could tell better truths, feminist self help in the 1970s drew together an affective economy of technoscience that hoped to challenge dominant practices. Embracing instrumentality, feminist self help did not just seek to simply reveal a new truth about reproductive health, but offered new practices for interacting with, caring about, and managing reproduction—to seize the means of reproduction. Vaginal self-exam, as a protocol, explicitly attempted to operate outside of professional and profit-driven bio- medicine, and hence grappled with the role of capitalism and authority in knowledge making by virtue of crafting alternative affective, embodied,</p>
<p>and political, rather than economically productive, epistemic values.</p>
<p>[. . .] Vaginal self-exam, as generated in an affective economy of tech- noscience, worked to materialize bodies and researchers in new ways, on the one hand, and was caught between feminist counter-conduct and broader historical developments, on the other. As part of the history of objectivity, vaginal self-exam signaled the emergence of affectively charged practices as a core epistemic value. This value was both heralded by feminists committed to emotion and embodiment in knowledge mak- ing, and given monetized value in gendered labor and entrepreneurial technoscience at the end of the century.</p>
<p><strong>Immodest Witnessing</strong></p>
<p>[. . .] The protocol for vaginal self-exam was disseminated in an abundance of instructional images in slide shows, mimeographed handouts, films, pamphlets, and books. The Los Angeles Feminist Women’s Health Center, in particular, took hundreds of photographs, some of cervixes, some of genitalia, others of the act of vaginal self-exam and other forms of</p>
<p>appropriated biomedical labor. Not simply a straightforward set of written directions, these visual practices and materials offered a particular way of visually manifesting a protocol as a practice of seeing. [. . .] Moreover, I want to argue, such visual practices were constitutive of a reassembled status of the subject in objectivity. I will call this new subject-figure the <em>immodest witness</em>.</p>
<p>In tracking the figure of the immodest witness of vaginal self-exam in the visual productions of feminist self help, I am inspired by the “material-semiotic” figures in the scholarship of Donna Haraway, where she takes the Cyborg, the OncoMouse, or the Modest Witness as oppo- sitional, and yet noninnocent, means to query technoscience. For Har- away, these are “performed images that can be inhabited” (1997, 11). What I am calling the <em>immodest witness</em> is likewise a complex oppositional and yet entangled subject-figure, incited into being not only in images, but also in practices, bodies, and affects. The visual tropes of vaginal self- exam functioned as procedural instructions, yet also as a generative reas- sembly of subjectivity and objectivity through embodiment. Starting with yourself in what you were studying, and highlighting your affective entanglements, were epistemic values that aspired to produce better, more accurate, knowledge. In addition, this vantage point promoted entanglements that offered a version of the scientist-subject as deeply responsible and implicated in her object of study. Simply put, who you were affected what you could know. For the immodest witness, subjectivity was not an abstract problem of seeing but a question of concrete and particular embodiment that promised a better—a more proximate and intimate— route to objectivity. [. . .]</p>
<p>Immodest witnessing [. . .] was explicitly both an object-making and subject-making process that elevated the layperson as expert in the par- ticularities of herself. I use the word <em>immodest</em> here to draw attention to the project of laying bare the importance of the subject in knowledge making, and of challenging notions of chastity and modesty that pre- vented women from displaying, valuing, or studying the female reproduc- tive body, or even marking the subject-figure of the scientist as sexed, and hence as a particular, not abstract, person. The visual practices of vaginal self-exam boldly announced the sexed embodiment of the laborer in knowledge production. For practitioners, the immodest witness was part</p>
<p>of a tactic of “demystification” concerned with unmasking the craft of knowledge hidden by professionalism, thereby drawing attention to who was allowed to participate in the labor of science, revealing what had pre- viously been obscured as actually the product of relations of power. [. . .] At the same time, in their elevation of experience and sensation as epistemic virtues, radical feminists tended to consider their knowledge- making practices as a return to an empiricism associated with the scien- tific revolution: “The decision to emphasize our own feelings and experiences as women and to test all generalizations and reading we did by our own experience was actually the scientific method of research. We were in effect repeating the 17th century challenge of science to scholasti- cism: study nature, not books, and put all theories to the test of living practice and action” (Sarachild 1975, 145). In this way, the feelings and experiences of immodest witnessing became a primary passage point through which the validity of already existent knowledge—such as Marx-</p>
<p>ist theory or biomedical descriptions—had to be tested.</p>
<p>The immodest witness was cleverly captured in the canonical self-help image of a woman examining herself with a mirror and a speculum. Unlike contemporaneous drawings of pelvic exams in gynecological textbooks— typically either a straight view into the vaginal canal, evoking the camera angles of pornography, or a cross section of disembodied organs with arms, legs, and head severed—images of the immodest witness put the viewer in the eyes of the woman examining herself. Our gaze is taken over our own pubis and into the mirror we are holding between our legs. In the mirror, the speculum guides our gaze to the cervix, yet the mirror as sym- bol of a transparent access to the world is resisted, for the illustration makes us aware of the mirror’s frame and interpellates us into our own embodied gaze. The sex of the observer could not be missed.</p>
<p>Acts of women studying their sexed bodies through their bodies cre- ated a recursive circuit that joined the observer and the observed in a single gesture. This conjoining, first, rendered the body under observation an object of inquiry active in its own observation and, second, rendered the observer an embodied figure entangled with the object under study. Hands were an important trope in the figuration of the “möbius” agency of the immodest witness, intended to convey the use of the observer’s senses, the generative lushness of the body itself, and the agency of the woman being examined. For example, hands figured prominently in the</p>
<p>feminist self help project of crafting a “new definition” of the clitoris, which dramatically expanded the anatomical scope of the clitoris, as well as pro- vided a sense of its detailed function. Illustrations of clitoral anatomy (drawn by Suzanne Gage, who developed much of the visual vocabulary for feminist self help) began with four drawings of fingers spreading the outer lips of a vagina, pulling back its hood, rolling the shaft, and squeez- ing the glans. [. . .]</p>
<p>The feminist self-help work on the clitoral study of 1978 was some of the most sexually charged research conducted, in which the process of orgasm itself was studied in a group (FFWHC 1991). [. . .] The revised cli- toris was brought into lively and timely embodiment through pleasure, touch, and sight in both the registers of practice and representation. This affect-drenched research into genitals, enfolding the feeling object with the desiring subject who disidentified with norms, was distinctly a form of queered research. While introductions to vaginal exam were able to avoid questions of sexuality as the signature upturned speculum handle obscured the clitoris from the scope of introductory observation, “advanced groups” were much more likely to sexualize their affective econ- omies of research. Advanced collectivities, for example, took up questions of ejaculation and lesbian health in intensely affective circumstances (Hornstein 1973). Thus, the immodest witness was also potentially an explicitly queered subject, who violated heteronormativity, not only by assuming the status of the scientist, but also by virtue of the affectively charged same-sex circuits of sensory observation of parts of the body deeply saturated with sexuality.</p>
<p><strong>Affective Economies and the Not Uncommon</strong></p>
<p>[. . .] Feminist self help did not use the term <em>affect</em>. It did, however, use the term <em>experience</em> as an emotional, sensual, and embodied value. Therefore, it is important to think through the question of affective economies in immodest witnessing by first considering the epistemic privilege with which feminist self help, as with radical feminism more generally, imbued “experience.” Perhaps the most crucial axiom of consciousness raising and feminist research was that all knowledge production should begin with women’s experiences. With feminist self help, however, experience was both the empirical material analyzed (the embodied experience of being</p>
<p>a “woman”) and the immediate encounter with one’s body produced through vaginal self-examination (the experience of looking at oneself). At work in statements such as “I saw this,” “I was there,” “I felt that” uttered at feminist self help meetings was the assertion of a purported epistemic privilege gained from the immediacy of observing one’s self. It shouldn’t be surprising, then, that the movement’s literature is loaded with the term <em>experience</em> and that its uses were both tangled and polyvalent. [. . .]</p>
<p>Though it may be tempting to take “experience” as a self-evident origi- nary point of explanation—as that which explains, not that which needs to be explained—I want to attend to how claims to represent experience operate by taking as given and already constituted the identities of those whose experiences are being represented; whereas the task of the critical historian is to excavate the production of subjectivities though the ways the evidence of experience is imbued with an authentic primacy. In other words, the “evidence of experience” needs to be historicized. [. . .] The now worn phrase “the personal is political,” coined by radical feminists in the late 1960s, was meant to signal the politicization of that which was previ- ously held as personal, individual, and even trivial, not the personalization of politics into a private domain of self-improvement (Hanisch 2000). And like consciousness raising, the first lesson one learned in a self help meet- ing was that of commonality: “What you thought was peculiar to you was in fact shared by everyone” (Downer 1999). At the same time, the slogan “the personal is political” captured a danger within the method: the insight that social structures manifested themselves in what seemed like idio- syncratic personal events could be used to elevate quite historically and geographically particular insights into problematic universals. [. . .]</p>
<p>Vaginal self-exam, and feminist self help more generally, were yet another iteration and rearrangement of consciousness-raising. The role of the evidence of experience in vaginal self-exam differed from conven- tional consciousness raising in that it included the “immediate concrete” moment of examining one’s own body (FFWHC 1981). [. . .] The evidence of experience joined together past reproductive, sexual, and medical events with the immediate moment of self-exam, which involved both the sensations of the speculum and the affective relations involved in the group, as well as the sensations of observation—what one saw, smelt, tasted, or felt. Immediacy was conveyed through rich sensory</p>
<p>narratives: the feeling of pressure as a speculum clicked into place, the pinkish color of the cervix with or without reddish hues, the moisture or dryness of the vaginal canal, the sweet or musky smell of secretions, the look of the curly or toothy flesh of a hymen. A woman might even taste the sticky residue left on the speculum once it was removed. [. . .] Biological variation—idiosyncratic health histories and anatomical quirks—were the incidental experiences to be gathered through a fine-grain corporeal atten- tion. When anatomical variations were collected in the self help clinic, feminist self helpers pointed to a shared reproductive body underneath— “below the waist and above the knees”—but this shared domain was nonetheless lively with variation (Gage 1999). Their intimate examination of reproductive variation was not primarily a search for ill health; in con- trast, it was an effort to remove reproduction from its association with pathology—“taking the routine into our own hands”—and revaluing embodiments in terms of, not in spite of, individual biological deviations. Further, instead of a straightforward search for the undergirding com- mon that characterized much consciousness raising, vaginal self-exam was crafted as a means to recognize that the “irregular is not uncommon.” This double negative of “not uncommon” is crucially different from “common.” Vaginal self-exam, as well as the research in “advanced groups,” sought to study the not uncommon as routine anatomical variation, as ordinary secretions, and as ubiquitous infections so that these phenomena could be depathologized and seen as more appropriate to “home care” by women</p>
<p>themselves than to medical care by doctors.</p>
<p>Attending to the not uncommon of reproductive health was likened to oral health practices—in terms of teeth brushing, gargling, self-inspection of the mouth. Both were practices done outside of medicine. Authority to judge one’s own vagina and thus “demystify” reproductive anatomy was made analogous to the unexceptional act of examining one’s own mouth. Unlike an organ—a technical term that might spring to mind when hear- ing the gynecological term “internal exam”—the mouth was an accessible cavity laypeople regularly inspected, took care of, and treated. Both were “open to the outside” with mucous membrane linings; neither were a sterile environment (FFWHC 1981, 24). Many things are put in the mouth, and so too with the vagina: fingers, penises, tampons, spermicidal foams and jellies, diaphragms, douches. And other things came out, not least of</p>
<p>which were babies. Thus, according to self help protocol, a woman should feel licensed to have the same access and relationship to her vagina as she does with her mouth. [. . .]</p>
<p>At the same time, the “not uncommon” was also a valuation of variation itself. Variation was its own epistemic virtue and, moreover, variation gave the evidence of experience a particular form, one which was concerned with searching for and positively appreciating idiosyncrasies. To this end, over the course of the decade the Federation of Feminist Women’s Health Centers (FFWHC) took hundreds of pictures of genitals and cervixes, recording a lush field of individual variety. In this way, so called not uncommon problems were refused the label of pathology or deviance, and instead were heralded as unexceptional variations that non-professionals could recognize, monitor, and manage. [. . .]</p>
<p>By attending to the personalized and interindividual difference within a group as the not uncommon, vaginal self-exam offered a mode of collect- ing data that called into being what I will call an <em>ontological collectivity</em>— a materialization of a continuous field of difference rather than a fixed form. That is, interindividual differences were not judged by an abstract norm, or in terms of a fixed fact; rather, they were assembled into a col- lectivity of living variation both between bodies and within any given body. Thus, for feminist self help, the category “woman” was not abso- lutely unitary; instead it was a living ontological collectivity across bodies and over time. [. . .]</p>
<p>The visual vocabulary of feminist self-help images captured this epis- temic value of variation. Most images were not only of embodied women; they were of the body of a particular woman, who might sport a pair of glasses, have scraggly pubic hair, or slouch (Gage 1999). The women rep- resented in these images were clearly raced, diverse, and individual. Specificity mattered, and immodest witnessing sought to carefully attend to the specificities of the individual body as well as the variations between bodies, corralling these variegated bodily expressions into the ambit of the figure of the “well-woman” (For more on the politics of the term well woman, see Murphy 2012b). Thus the immodest witness was the exemplar of a quite remarkable reassembly of objectivity that altered, one, the sta- tus of the subject (as particular, embodied, and affectively entangled with its object of study) and, two, the epistemic values of observation (valuing variation, sensation, and emotion individually and collectively).</p>
<p>At the same time, attention to the not uncommon asked participants to recognize themselves in each other according to the protocols of consciousness-raising group work. In fashioning this web of mutual sum- moning, practitioners were not simply discerning common patterns; they were evoking each other as politicized and connected subjects. Speaking across a circle, women recognized each other as embodied agents capable of truth claims. “Responding with recognition” thus asked women to valo- rize one another as highly individualized truth-tellers and to align as part of a politically charged cohort of “women,” a more abstract commonality. Thus, the importance of individuality to the ontological collectivity cre- ated by vaginal self-exam was in tension with the necessity of invoking woman as a universalizable sex. [. . .]</p>
<p>The immodest witness, therefore, was formed through contradictions. Practitioners were simultaneously hailed as representatives of a politi- cized class (women) and as singular individuals. They were simultaneously implicated agents responsible to that which they studied, and an object of inquiry that spoke for itself. Immodest witnessing was structured by this tension of interplay between women as variegated individuals, as members of a common class, and as participants in a research group col- lectivity. The assumed common sex of participants excluded other ways of marking difference and drawing together collective life. Moreover, the values of individualized variation and comparison among peers was premised on the bracketing off, and even the erasure of, the complex cir- cumstances that placed some women as agents over the fate of others. The assumption that women were invested in the fate of each other simply by virtue of also being women belied the contradictory ways women were riven and bound by uneven biopolitical topologies of late twentieth- century America (for a detailed version of this argument, see Murphy 2012a). While the figure of the immodest witness performed a radical implosion of the subject/object in observations, making visible the embodied and affective subject in the production of knowledge, the immodest witness simultaneously tended to foreground sexed and indi- vidualized embodiment at the expense of a more complexly situated, interlocking, and thus more complicit, map of subject making in knowl- edge production. [. . .]</p>
<p>In sum, affective entanglements in practices of vaginal self-exam cir- culated in multiple dimensions. In the moment of immodest witnessing,</p>
<p>knowing was an embodied, sensory, and recursive act that situated sub- jects as particular. In the collective project of feminist self help, affective entanglements formed a moral economy of affirmation—of the happiness of knowing oneself through bonding and of recognition of oneself in others as a politicizable collectivity. At the same time, objectivity was reas- sembled as a project of self-knowing only possible in politically and affec- tively charged relations with other subjects.</p>
<p>Immodest witnessing, however, can also be examined through an expanded sense of “affective entanglements.” The epistemic value granted individualizing and yet bonding affective knowing was, in the 1970s, attached to a larger political economy that helped to set its conditions of possibility. On the one hand, affective entanglements were a form of counter-conduct reacting to practices of dispassionate, professionalized, patronizing, and even coercive scientific authority. On the other hand, they exemplified tendencies in contemporary American culture that called on subjects to release and express their feelings and desires as political, therapeutic, and entrepreneurial acts. While calls to name and fulfill desires through lifestyle consumption and entrepreneurial vitality were deeply antagonistic to radical feminism, such injunctions were nonethe- less part of feminist self help’s world, and implicated with their effort to elevate affect as a means to find emancipation (see, for example, Rofel 2007). In other words, feminist self help was animated in broader circula- tions of affect that went beyond their own practices. [. . .]1</p>
<p><strong>Ontological Collectivities, Liveliness, and Biovalue</strong></p>
<p>[. . .] It was in the advanced research groups of feminist self-help that the most intensive efforts to rematerialize reproduction as a lush liveliness took place. [. . .] In self help clinics, participants were encouraged to take daily observations on their own, perhaps including a quick sketch of what they saw in a journal or calendar that they could later puzzle over with the group. These repetitious chronological traces could be assembled into a portrait of minute change over time, further expanding the topography of variation into the dimension of temporal change. Rather than compar- ing themselves to an abstract, universalized norm (as one might find in a medical textbook), in using the technique of vaginal self-exam they relied on comparisons within small groups of women and with each woman’s</p>
<p>own changes over time. This schooled attention to slight variations in anatomical detail over time produced a sense of lush, changing variety through which the feminist self help movement sought to remap the ana- tomical terms of healthfulness. Healthfulness here was a disidentification from abstract norms in favor of shifting dynamic forms.</p>
<p>This rearticulation of healthfulness as a lush garden of shifting ana- tomical diversity extended beyond macroscopic features to include micro- organisms ubiquitously present in vaginas that could cause common and minor, though sometimes recalcitrant, infections. This microscopic varia- tion was dubbed the “ecology of the vagina” (FFWHC 1981, 24–25). While viewing a drop of vaginal secretions with a microscope, self helpers taught themselves to see “sloughed-off cells from the vaginal wall, a few yeast plants, lots of bacteria and sometimes even a few one-celled animals, trichomonads” (FFWHC 1981, 24). If a woman was menstruating, she would see red blood cells. If she had recently had heterosexual inter- course, she might see sperm. As with their gross observations, self help- ers were concerned with noticing how the exact constituency of a vaginal ecology would change over time, often in synchrony with the changing pH of the menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>This sense of a vaginal ecology was aided by microscopy. A manual of procedures in a Well Woman clinic, called the <em>Black Book</em> (written to defend against accusations of practicing medicine without a license), explained that using a microscope “is simply an aid to better eyesight” (FWHC 1976). [. . .] Though strategically represented as a simple magnification of eye- sight, the ability to perceive a wet mount slide as a vaginal ecology was by necessity a learned technique of observation that called for assembling details into a relationship of changing diversity. Looking in a microscope was not a neutral gaze taking in a self-evident world; it was a repeated act made sense of by a politicalized apparatus (the self help clinic) that re- represented entities already codified by conventional gynecology. [. . .] The practice of vaginal self-exam not only schooled women in fine-grained sensory observations, it simultaneously refigured their object of study— vaginal ecologies—in a way that authorized the very act of intimate fre- quent personal observation.</p>
<p>The elaborate daily attention to minute changes of one’s vagina and cervix reached its pinnacle in the Menstrual Cycle Study of 1975, also undertaken as part of the Federation book project.2 Every morning,</p>
<p>during a full menstrual cycle, a cadre of nine women gathered to make thirty-six time-consuming observations about their own bodies. [. . .]</p>
<p>What was rendered perceptible through this elaborate and tedious col- lecting and cataloguing of detail? The study did not conclude with a sum- mary description of a menstrual cycle. Nor did it identify a series of markers that identified distinct stages. Instead, the study concluded what it was designed to perceive—precisely the converse: women do not match an abstracted cycle, and healthfulness cannot be accurately measured through a once-a-year marker like a Pap smear. [. . .] What a “normal” menstrual cycle looked like, so they argued, could only be determined by studying “each woman’s cycle within the context of the cycle itself as opposed to comparing to a norm,” thereby “redefining and individualizing the concept of ‘normal’ for women” (FWHC 1975). Since doctors relied on annual visits and did not have the time to make such painstaking daily observations on each patient, women occupied a privileged position for understanding this complexity. Using odor as an intimate organizing affective entry point could, for example, produce a disorienting anatomi- cal portrait unlike that found in any medical textbook. Feminist self help strongly encouraged women to use smell, and not just eyesight, to track their vaginal ecology. [. . .]</p>
<p>Materializing reproductive embodiment as a highly valued, dynamic, and generative domain of variation and affect, through practices explicitly considered radical, nonetheless had a synergistic relationship with new modes of valuing living-being, particularly in research with biotechnolo- gies indebted to the reproductive sciences. While feminists of the 1970s were more likely to characterize medicine as treating women’s bodies like machines in industrial assembly lines, and while this was certainly a domi- nant organizational motif for apprehending the body, the 1970s was also a moment of emerging biotechnology, particularly in California, and the beginning of a new era of clinical reproductive medicine concerned with the technical choreography of fertility at micrological levels (see Davis- Floyd 2003; Martin 1991). Through the arrival of reproductive medicine, the 1970s was an important decade for the refiguration of what the femi- nist technoscience scholar Catherine Waldby calls <em>biovalue</em>. Biovalue names the “yield of vitality produced by the biotechnical reformulation of living processes” (2002, 310). [. . .] As I argued above, calls to express indi- vidualized desires not linked to mass culture could enable new modes of</p>
<p>hitching affect to capital in marketing. In a similar way, the oppositional ontological politics of heralding the ways living-being can synergistically generate difference and affect reverberate with capitalism’s requirement for exuberant territories through which to implant and recycle value.</p>
<p><strong>Topologies of Situated Feminist Technoscience</strong></p>
<p>[. . .] As a situated knowledge, then, the broad lesson to be learned from historicizing vaginal self-exam is that the “how” of knowing is as much a question of the promise and limits of affectively charged counter-conduct, as much a question of subjectivation in noninnocent economies, of entan- gled reassemblies and appropriations, and of marked and unmarked labor as it is a historical episode in the history of objectivity. Rather than an odd marginal practice only of interest to feminists, vaginal self-exam announces a particular reassembly of objectivity in the late twentieth century, with the generative features of counter-conduct, affect, and biovalue at its heart. [. . .] Feminist self help, with vaginal self-exam as its iconic protocol, was one of the most sustained efforts to practice science as feminism. It was also a reassembly of objectivity that reverberates in participatory meth- odologies of many political stripes today. What was the fate of vaginal self-exam? Rarely practiced today, vaginal self-exam declined both for rea- sons from within and without. As the Reagan era unfolded [. . .] militant antiabortion activists besieged Feminist Women’s Health Centers. The day-to-day harassment and the imminent threat of violence created a “siege mentality” within the centers’ walls (Hasper, Heckert, and Schnitger 1999). The incredible amount of energy, emotional and physical, that went into escorting women through blockades, into clinic security, into court cases, into finding doctors willing to work under the threat of violence, and into rebuilding destroyed clinics drastically redirected the labor of the</p>
<p>feminist self help movement.</p>
<p>From within the women’s health movement, their very success deflated the consciousness-raising power the vaginal self-exam had enjoyed in the 1970s. A new moral economy of health care arose—calling for the well- educated, well-informed, self-knowing patient to be prepared to advocate for herself as a consumer within corporate medical institutions. Put simply, in the last thirty years the status of white, middle-class women as patients has dramatically changed, and thus so too did the biggest</p>
<p>constituency that the affective economy of vaginal self-exam had appealed to. While the practice today is rare, the assembly of affective engagement, particular embodiment, injunctions to empowerment, intimate attention, collective labor, and generative living-being coils forward.</p>
