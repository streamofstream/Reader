<p><strong>Biocapital, 2017</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stefan Helmreich and Nicole Labruto</strong></p>
<p><code></code><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p><code></code>e store of science studies work theorizing the conjuncture of economic action and biotechnology is well stocked. Scholars in anthropology, sociol- ogy,  history,  and  literary  theory  have  generated  a  variety  of  concepts: biovalue, genetic capital, the biotech mode of (re)production, the organic phase of capitalism, genomic capital, life as surplus, the bioeconomy, and, perhaps most prominently, <em>biocapital</em>, which is becoming the prevailing coin in academic exchanges about contemporary unions of biological sci- ence with profit- oriented enterprise. A taxonomy of <em>species of biocapital</em> is in order.</p>
<p><code></code>e word <em>species</em> refers not just to durable, though mutable, life forms but also to  a particular kind or sort of coin or money  (OED), so that a classifica- tion of kinds of biocapital may take the form of an intellectual phylogeny or of an accounting or both. Following Pierre Bourdieu (<a href='#_page20_x47.00_y54.14'>1991 </a>[1982]), who first defined four  species of capital  (economic, cultural, social, and symbolic) and showed how they might be convertible into one another, such a classification <img src="Aspose.Words.d21eaee7-26fb-4e91-aacd-38cab1b9dae0.001.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>

<p>What is biocapital? Scholarship in the social study of biology has suggested that in the age of biotechnology, when the substances and promises of biologi- cal materials, particularly stem cells and genomes, are increasingly inserted into projects of product-making and -seeking, we witness the rise of a novel kind of capital: biocapital.  e term, paging back to Marx, fixes attention on the dynamics of labor and commoditization that characterize the making and marketing of such entities as industrial and pharmaceutical bioproducts. It gives a fresh name to a phenomenon that Edward Yoxen, writing at the dawn of the biotech revolution in  Life as a productive force: capitalizing upon research in molecular biology , described as  not simply a way of using living things that can be traced back to the Neolithic origins of fermentation and agriculture  but  a technology controlled by capital,   a specific mode of the appropriation  of  living  nature literally  capitalizing  life   (<a href='#_page25_x50.00_y229.14'>1981,  p</a>.  112). Biocapital also extends Foucault s <em>biopolitics</em>, that practice of governance that brought  life  and  its  mechanisms  into  the  realm  of  explicit  calculations  (Foucault <a href='#_page21_x50.00_y79.14'>1978,</a> p. 143).  eorists of biocapital posit that such calculations no  longer  organize  only  state,  national,  or  colonial  governance  but  also increasingly format economic enterprises that take as their object the creation, from biotic material and information to value, markets, wealth, and profit.  e biological entities that inhabit this landscape are also no longer only indi - viduals and populations the twin poles of Foucault s biopower but also cells, molecules, genomes, and genes.</p>
<p>Stem cells have been potent objects on this landscape because of their, well, potency or better, their potential potency, their capacity, under finely tuned circumstances, to grow into diverse sorts of cells, cells that might be employed as resources for regenerative medicine. One might argue that stem cells are animated by a double fetishism infused with vitality because of the erasure of the labor and regulation that allows them to appear  in themselves  in such places as laboratories and simultaneously imbued with life because of their origin in living things. Whether such fetishism dovetails with commod- ity fetishism is a complicated question certainly stem cells  relation to mar - ket, gift, and national economics and imaginaries is multiple but one of the more general claims of the present chapter will be that biological potency as such, in biocommerce, is often (mis)taken to be a primordial ontology upon which biocapitalism merely elaborates.</p>
<p><code></code>is chapter began as a review of two books. Kaushik Sunder Rajan s <a href='#_page24_x47.00_y366.14'>2006 </a><em>Biocapital:  e Constitution of Postgenomic Life</em> (Duke) and Nikolas Rose s </p>
<p><a href='#_page24_x47.00_y129.14'>2007 </a> <em>e Politics of Life Itself: Biomedicine, Power, and Subjectivity in the</em> </p>
<p><em>Twenty-First Century</em> (Princeton) each propose a diagnosis of scientific, ethi- cal, and cultural transformations in the way we think of life biological and social in the era of capitalized molecular biology, biotechnology, and stem cell and genomic medicine.</p>
<p>Sunder Rajan s <em>Biocapital</em> argues that life science commodities for example, therapeutic molecules, genome sequences, and pharmaceuticals that promise future health require analysis of capitalist practices as well as of the correlated citizen, corporate, and scientific subjectivities materializing alongside such activ- ities. University and corporate biosciences have become porous to one another, with the circulation of biomaterials between labs governed by novel regimes of buying and selling regimes set in place by regulatory transformations permit - ting the holding of intellectual property in biological matter and knowledge. Contouring this landscape, too, are infusions into genomics of money from venture capital. Speculative finance mirrors the speculations of biotechnology.  e subjectivities in the making for scientists, doctors, and patient advocacy groups also tune to future-looking financescapes.  e biocapitalist ethos takes nationally particular forms, too. US rhetoric organizes around sentiments of <em>salvation</em>, seeing the promise of genetic medicine in millennial terms, powered by languages of hope and hype; Weber s  <em>e Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</em> ([2001 [](#<em>page25_x50.00_y179.14)1[905]) ](#</em>page25_x50.00_y179.14)is the key intertext here. In India, a narrative that highlights the importance to the nation of biotechnology prevails; bioproducts promise to make India a  global player . Biocapital also depends on older, colo- nial structures of subordination as well as on new logics, requiring examination of  where value resides as biology becomes an information science  (p. 41). Sunder Rajan thus tracks permutations in the  explicit calculations  about  life and its mechanisms  that Foucault saw as key to biopower.</p>
<p>In  <em>e Politics of Life Itself</em>, Rose explores how novel forms of personhood, citizenship, race, brain/mind, and crime are under construction as people posi- tion themselves in relation to technologies of genetic mapping, genetic diagno- sis, genetic counseling, genetic therapy, and genetic profiling. Contemporary biopolitics operates at the level of the <em>molecular</em> and from that seat organizes landscapes of risk and ethical subjectification. Family, personhood, race, and crime are refigured as the stuff of biology is made malleable. Rose concludes  <em>e Politics of Life Itself</em> with a meditation on   e Spirit of Biocapitalism , detecting </p>
<p>an  elective affinity  between the new molecular bioeconomics of  life itself  and the modes through which, for example, doctors and patients work on human corporeal being, a corporeal being increasingly fungible and multiple.</p>
<p>Sunder Rajan and Rose have not been alone in their analyses. Below, to make sense of the genesis of discussions of biocapital is a timeline of publica- tions, starting with Marx:</p>
<p><strong>1867</strong></p>
<p>Karl Marx in <em>Capital</em> defines <em>use value</em> and <em>exchange value</em> as, respectively, the </p>
<p>value of things in use and the value that things acquire when set against one another  as  commodities.  For  Marx  (who  inherited  these  terms  from Aristotle, Luther, and Smith), use value could be natural or conventional, though Marx sometimes described  nature   materialized in such sub - stances as cultivated soil or the human body as containing  means of pro - duction already produced  (quoted in Franklin <a href='#_page21_x50.00_y166.14'>2007, </a>p. 106).  is framing posits  generativity  (or  reproductivity)  as  an  elemental  property  of  the natural.<a href='#_page18_x97.00_y345.14'>1</a></p>
<p><strong>1884</strong></p>
<p>Frederick Engels in  <em>e Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State</em></p>
<p>theorizes a distinction between means of production and means of repro- duction, suggesting that women s subjection in marriage is aided by their domination as a class of unpaid workers responsible for the material repro- duction of persons in households.</p>
<p><strong>1905</strong></p>
<p>Max Weber in  <em>e Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</em> suggests that in </p>
<p>post-Reformation Europe, Calvinist ethics of hard work and rationality underwrote the assignation of moral meaning to capital accumulation, which could be read by believers as a secular sign of salvation for which they were already predestined.</p>
<p><strong>1976</strong></p>
<p>Michel Foucault in  <em>e History of Sexuality, Vol. 1</em>, theorizes <em>biopower</em> as that </p>
<p>which made it possible for nation-states to bring  life and its mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculations , that is, to summon forth the bodies of individuals and populations as elements to be governed and managed in the  service  of  such  social  imperatives  as  nation-building  and  colonial expansion.</p>
<p><strong>1981</strong></p>
<p>Feminist scholars Olivia Harris and Kate Young, commenting on Engels in </p>
<p><code></code>Engendered structures: some problems in the analysis of reproduction , argue against naturalizing that is, locating in the ground of the biologi - cal a distinction between reproduction and production.</p>
<p><strong>1981</strong></p>
<p>Marxist scholar Edward Yoxen publishes  Life as a productive force: capital-</p>
<p>izing upon research in molecular biology , in which he argues that a shift in the  appropriation of living nature  takes place when capital begins to oper- ate on biotic stuff at the molecular level.</p>
<p><strong>1987</strong></p>
<p>Literary critic Hortense Spillers (<a href='#_page24_x47.00_y241.14'>1987)</a> in  Mama s baby, papa s maybe  exam-</p>
<p>ines how the reproductive capacity of slaves under chattel slavery in the antebellum American South was conscripted by slaveholders into produc- ing more slaves as property and as potential capital.</p>
<p><strong>1988</strong></p>
<p>Rural sociologist Jack Kloppenburg <a href='#_page22_x47.00_y341.14'>(1988),</a> in  <em>First the Seed:  e Political</em> </p>
<p><em>Economy of Plant Biotechnology, 1492 2000</em>, offers a history of the capital- ization of plant matter.</p>
<p><strong>1992</strong></p>
<p>Anthropologist Paul Rabinow in  Artificiality and enlightenment  coins the </p>
<p>term <em>biosociality</em>, arguing that genetics, immunology, and environmental - ism are  leading vehicles for the infiltration of technoscience, capitalism, and culture into what the moderns called  nature  (<a href='#_page23_x50.00_y454.14'>1992, </a>p. 245).</p>
<p><strong>1992</strong></p>
<p>Anthropologist Marilyn Strathern in  <em>After Nature</em>  (<a href='#_page24_x47.00_y291.14'>1992a)</a> and <em>Reproducing</em> </p>
<p><em>the Future</em> (<a href='#_page24_x47.00_y316.14'>1992b) </a>describes biological substance modified and capitalized as  nature, enterprised-up .</p>
<p><strong>1993</strong></p>
<p>Ecologist Walter V. Reid (<a href='#_page23_x50.00_y504.14'>1993</a>) publishes  Bioprospecting: a force for sustain-</p>
<p>able development  in <em>Environmental Science and Technology</em>.  e term, a compression of  biodiversity prospecting , refers to scouting in  natural  set- tings (e.g. rainforests) for biological material (e.g. from plants) or informa- tion (e.g. traditional or indigenous knowledge) that may provide leads for natural products that can be industrialized or commercialized.</p>
<p><strong>1995</strong></p>
<p>Historian Harriet Ritvo (<a href='#_page23_x50.00_y554.14'>1995</a>) in  Possessing Mother Nature  offers a history </p>
<p>of the remaking of livestock breeding in eighteenth-century Britain, when curated pedigrees emerged as tools to establish markets in what she terms <em>genetic capital</em> (see also Derry <a href='#_page20_x47.00_y329.14'>2003 on</a> the profit motive in breeding cattle, dogs, and horses beginning in 1800).</p>
<p><strong>1997</strong></p>
<p>In  <em>Modest_Witness@Second_Millennium</em>,  the  historian  of  biology  Donna </p>
<p>Haraway (<a href='#_page21_x50.00_y391.14'>1997</a>) discusses a shift  from kind to brand  in the taxonomy of living things in the days of biotechnology. OncoMouse  is an exemplar of the new branded biology.</p>
<p><strong>1997</strong></p>
<p>Physicist and critic of development Vandana Shiva (<a href='#_page24_x47.00_y204.14'>1997)</a> publishes <em>Biopiracy:</em> </p>
<p><code></code><em>e Plunder of Nature and Knowledge</em>, building on then recent activist anal-</p>
<p>yses of bioprospecting that construe the activity as a neocolonial practice of resource  extraction,  in  which  wealthy  nations  or  companies  dispossess poorer nations or people of their territorial, organic, or ethnobotanical inheritances, often at profit.</p>
<p><strong>2000</strong></p>
<p>Historian Hannah Landecker (<a href='#_page22_x47.00_y441.14'>2000),</a> in  Immortality, <em>in vitro</em> , examines the </p>
<p>case of the immortalized cancer cells of Henrietta Lacks, showing how they were serially imagined as valuable as the gift to science of an unknown woman, as the property of science, and, when they were discovered to orig- inate in the body of a black woman, as two things: by some scientists, in line with racist visions of black sexuality, as hyperfecund, and by Lacks s family and advocates as a sign of an historical and continuing dispossession in  the  United  States  of  black  women  from  their  bodies  as  property. Landecker made early versions of this argument in  Between beneficence and chattel: the human biological in law and science  (<a href='#_page22_x47.00_y391.14'>1999).</a></p>
<p><strong>2000</strong></p>
<p>Medical sociologist Catherine Waldby coins the term  <em>biovalue</em>,  generated </p>
<p>wherever the generative and transformative productivity of living entities can be instrumentalized along lines which make them useful for human projects  (<a href='#_page25_x50.00_y129.14'>2000,</a> p. 33).</p>
<p><strong>2001</strong></p>
<p>Anthropologist Chaia Heller  (<a href='#_page22_x47.00_y54.14'>2001)</a> in  McDonalds, MTV, and Monsanto: </p>
<p>resisting biotechnology in the age of informational capital  theorizes  bio- technology as a mode of production , argues that scholars might name a new moment in capitalism, <em>the organic phase of capitalism</em>, in which  capital targets the reproductive dimensions of cultural and biological life as loci for intensified production and commodification .</p>
<p><strong>2001</strong></p>
<p>Science studies scholar Mike Fortun  (<a href='#_page20_x47.00_y516.14'>2001)</a> in  Mediated speculations in the </p>
<p>genomics  futures  markets   suggests  that  understanding  the  business  of genomics requires attention to its speculative logic, which he examines by demonstrating  the  role  of  forward-looking  statements   in  generating investment and profit.  is work elaborates his earlier interest in the rheto - ric of speed in genomics <a href='#_page20_x47.00_y479.14'>(1999</a>) and sets the stage for his 2002 argument that genomics operates in the  future anterior , the <em>what-will-have-been</em></p>
<p>the promise an argument he will elaborate in <em>Promising Genomics: Iceland</em> </p>
<p><em>and deCODE Genetics in a World of Speculation</em> (<a href='#_page21_x50.00_y54.14'>2008).</a></p>
<p><strong>2001</strong></p>
<p>Anthropologist Margaret Lock s   e alienation of body tissue and the bio -</p>
<p>politics of immortalized cell lines  (<a href='#_page23_x50.00_y104.14'>2001</a>) fuses political economic analysis with Foucauldian attention to body politics.</p>
<p><strong>2001</strong></p>
<p>Sociologist Nikolas Rose argues that new markets in health create a circum-</p>
<p>stance in which  biopolitics becomes bioeconomics  <a href='#_page24_x47.00_y116.14'>(2001,</a> p. 15).</p>
<p><strong>2003</strong></p>
<p>Anthropologists Sarah Franklin and Margaret Lock define <em>biocapital</em> as a kind </p>
<p>of wealth that depends upon a  form of extraction that involves isolating and mobilizing the primary reproductive agency of specific body parts, particularly cells, in a manner not dissimilar to that by which, as Marx described it, soil plays the  principal  role in agriculture  (<a href='#_page21_x50.00_y191.14'>2003, </a>p. 8). Franklin and Lock understand this biocapital to be underwritten not only by production but also by reproduction.  eir thinking emerges from a May 2000 conference at the School of American Research, which they recall thus:  Imagining ourselves (re)writing volume 1 of (bio)<em>Capital</em>, we attempted to specify as precisely as possible the range of forces at work in the transformation of life and death into means to (re)production and, in turn, into component parts that together compose an emergent global bio- logical economy  (p. 13). Franklin s contribution to  <em>Remaking Life and Death: Toward an Anthropology of the Biosciences</em>, the volume that emerged from this workshop, was entitled  Ethical biocapital .</p>
<p><strong>2003</strong></p>
<p>Sociologist Charis  ompson argues that the  <em>biotech mode of (re)production</em></p>
<p>operates with  promissory capital ,  capital raised for speculative ventures on the strength of promised future returns  (quoted in Franklin and Lock <a href='#_page21_x50.00_y191.14'>2003,</a> pp. 6 7). In her  <em>Making Parents:  e Ontological Choreography of Reproductive Technologies</em>,  ompson turns her attention to what she calls </p>
<p>the  biomedical mode of reproduction  (2005).</p>
<p><strong>2003</strong></p>
<p>Science studies scholar Kaushik Sunder Rajan in  Genomic capital: public </p>
<p>cultures and market logics of corporate biotechnology  defines   biocapitalism  as that which asks,  how  life  gets redefined through the contradictory processes of commodification  <a href='#_page24_x47.00_y341.14'>(2003</a>, p. 87). His biocapitalism has five fea- tures:  a  rhetoric  of  speed,  corporate/university  connections,  porosity between commodity and gift economies in labs, excessive production, and biosocialities tuned to market logics.</p>
<p><strong>2003</strong></p>
<p>Anthropologist Cori Hayden in <em>When Nature Goes Public:  e Making and</em> </p>
<p><em>Unmaking of Bioprospecting in Mexico</em> shows how bioprospectors often seek </p>
<p>to create capital through channeling biodiversity through  slightly choppy  (<a href='#_page21_x50.00_y529.14'>2003,</a> p. 10) networks that mix economies of purchase, benefit-sharing, dispossession, profit, and promise, many of which turn out to be situated in larger frames of North-South political economic inequality.</p>
<p><strong>2005</strong></p>
<p>Literary theorist Eugene  acker in  <em>e Global Genome</em> (2005<a href='#_page24_x47.00_y504.14'>) fixes</a> on how </p>
<p>the fluidity of genetic information as data permits it to be used as a cur- rency in globalization.  acker draws on the Marx of the <em>Grundrisse</em> as well </p>
<p>as on Foucault to develop a theory of  biological exchange  that aligns information  management  with  moments  in  the  movement  of  capital: encoding/production,  recoding/circulation,  and  decoding/consumption.  acker thinks through the excess of bio-information using the work of Georges Bataille <a href='#_page19_x50.00_y495.14'>(1967)</a> in  <em>e Accursed Share</em>, which argues that the accu- mulation of surplus is not always fed back into production, but is often spectacularly spent on lavish wastage.</p>
<p><strong>2006</strong></p>
<p>Kaushik Sunder Rajan in <em>Biocapital:  e Constitution of Postgenomic Life</em> fol-</p>
<p>lows Marx in parsing <em>biocapital</em> into industrial, commodity capital (such as therapeutic molecules) and speculative, commercial capital (such as stocks), which later are often underwritten by quasi-religious sentiment, in the way Weber  argued  that  the  rise  of  merchant  capital  was  motored  by  the Protestant ethic. Sunder Rajan uses Bataille to think about how speculation underwrites and permits practices of excess, particularly in the over-the-top expenditures of biotechnology start-ups in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>2006</strong></p>
<p>Anthropologists Adriana Petryna, Andrew Lakoff, and Arthur Kleinman in </p>
<p><em>Global  Pharmaceuticals:  Ethics,  Markets,  Practices</em>  (<a href='#_page23_x50.00_y429.14'>2006)  examine</a>  the inequalities that organize world distribution and markets in pharmaceuti - cals, a global economy in which access and excess are often inversely related.  ey draw on Bourdieu s notion of capital to locate pharmaceutical econo - mies of patents, products, and promises in regimes of economic, cul - tural, material, and symbolic capital.  ey do not put the package together </p>
<p>as <em>biocapital</em> though Lakoff argues that in pharmacogenomics,  Biopolitics and the market were to be brought together through the application of genomic knowledge  (2005, p. 171).</p>
<p><strong>2007</strong></p>
<p>Nikolas Rose extends earlier arguments of his that a  mutation  from <em>biopolitics</em> to </p>
<p><em>bioeconomics</em> characterizes the dominant social order in at least the United States and Europe, writing that  vitality has been decomposed into a series of distinct and discrete objects, that can be stabilized, frozen, banked, stored, accumulated, exchanged, traded across time, across space, across organs and species, across diverse contexts and enterprises, in the service of bioeconomic objectives  <a href='#_page24_x47.00_y129.14'>(2007,</a> 67). Rose notes that biocapital is already a phrase circulating in the world of pharmaceuticals, frequently as a company name or service.</p>
<p><strong>2007</strong></p>
<p>Sarah Franklin in <em>Dolly Mixtures</em> looks at the history of  stock  in livestock to </p>
<p>think about the braided logic of breeding and wealth creation, from pre- capitalist to capitalist modes of accumulation, writing that  capital in the older sense of stock derives out of a combination of genealogy, property and instrumentality  (<a href='#_page21_x50.00_y166.14'>2007, </a>p. 57).</p>
<p><strong>2007</strong></p>
<p>Science studies scholar Joseph Dumit theorizes <em>surplus health</em> as that which </p>
<p>pharmaceutical companies conjure in order to  add medications to our life through lowering the level of risk required to be  at risk   (quoted in Sunder Rajan <a href='#_page24_x47.00_y416.14'>2007,</a> p. 81). Dumit s Biomarks (or, sometimes, BioMarx) experi - ment operates by substituting  health  for  labor  in <em>Capital</em> (consult Dumit <a href='#_page20_x47.00_y354.14'>2012).</a></p>
<p><strong>2007</strong></p>
<p>Political theorist Melinda Cooper (<a href='#_page20_x47.00_y229.14'>2007)</a> in  Life, autopoiesis, debt: inventing </p>
<p>the bioeconomy  argues that capitalist culture operates through  delirium , in which the drive of capital to overcome its own material limitations not only  finds  new  resources  but  also  constantly  redefines  the  nature   of resources (e.g. through turning debt or other crisis moments into value) in order to create surplus. Her later book <em>Life as Surplus</em> (<a href='#_page20_x47.00_y254.14'>2008) </a>elaborates this argument.</p>

<p><code></code>e timeline, though organized stratigraphically, also does not indicate which writers relied upon which to develop their arguments which could trace how the concept of biocapital has developed. Co-citation or co-word analysis might make common links clear (see Cambrosio, et al. <a href='#_page20_x47.00_y191.14'>1993),</a> though a search for  biocapital  in  omson Scientific s Web of Science database in 2008 yielded only five journal articles. Plugging  biocapital  into Google Scholar in 2008 picked out Franklin and Sunder Rajan as key exponents of the concept, showing 24 citations to Sarah Franklin s <a href='#_page21_x50.00_y116.14'>2003 </a>articulation and 28 to Sunder Rajan s <a href='#_page24_x47.00_y366.14'>2006 </a>book and, strikingly, since both publish in anthro- pological venues, no cross-citations between the two, suggesting that there may be two scholarly conversations in motion here. A simple scientometric approach, of course, would be difficult to cash out as a full tracing of influ- ence. Different scholars cast more and less finely meshed citation nets.</p>
<p><code></code>ese caveats in mind, just below is a tentative genealogy, full, as all gene - alogies are of repetitions, omissions, mistakes, surprises. Its nodes are the names of authors of peer-reviewed, published works that contribute to discus- sions of biocapital. Names are keyed to years and each scholar appears only once (in connection with either their first articulation of a concept important to biocapital or their most significant statement on the matter).  e lines represent direct, more-than-in-passing citation. Turning away from the auto- matic information gathering of citation analysis, I sought to locate authors  developments of concepts central to biocapital by using an antique method: reading (Fig. <a href='#_page9_x40.00_y311.14'>35.1).</a></p>

<p>One  cluster around  Sarah  Franklin,  Margaret  Lock,  and  Charis </p>
<p><code></code>ompson, and drawing on Marilyn Strathern, Donna Haraway, and Paul Rabinow might be called Marxist feminist. Here the binary of <em>production</em> versus <em>reproduction</em> is key, as are questions to do with sex/gender and race (particularly  in  work  about  reproductive  technology).  e  remaking  of boundaries between <em>nature</em> and <em>culture</em> is a central concern one reason atten - tion to the changing substances and generativities of biology, emblematized by Hannah Landecker s work on the history of tissue culture, is also a signa- ture feature of this scholarship.</p>
<p>A second cluster around Kaushik Sunder Rajan, Eugene  acker, and Michael Fortun, and drawing on Haraway and Rabinow pays attention to questions of meaning, though less to biomatter. Focusing on questions of information management and speculation, this scholarship has a Weberian flavor. Call it Weberian Marxist; relations of production are described along- side accountings of ethical subjectivity.</p>
<p>Strains of each line are present in the other. And Marx s political economy and Foucault s biopolitics operate as crucial conditions of possibility for each. Melinda Cooper s work marks a fusion of the lines.<a href='#_page18_x97.00_y483.14'>2</a></p>
<p>Another feature of the discussion that leaps out is the acceleration of the discussion in the late twentieth century. For scholars interested in new kinds of financial speculation of genomics, biocapital tracks biotechnological inno- vation (recombinant DNA, PCR) as well as the history of legal agreements between universities and companies about the commercialization of univer- sity property, which begins in 1980 with the passage in the US Congress of the Bayh-Dole Act, which permitted universities and their employees to retain rights in patented inventions developed with federal monies and, if desired, to license or sell those inventions to private business. Academic-industrial bio- tech hybrids became common in the United States after the Supreme Court in  1980  permitted  the  patenting  of  modified  organisms  in  <em>Diamond  v. Chakrabarty</em>.  For  theorists  of  biocapital  interested  in  the  intercalation  of reproductive technologies (IVF, cloning, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis) with new kinds of relations of commoditization (of women s reproductive labor, most notably), biocapital is entangled with changing relations of repro- duction and kinship.</p>
<p><code></code>e two schools of thinking on biocapital also have distinct orientations: they represent two sides of what, once upon a time, was called the <em>substantivist</em> position in economic anthropology. Against <em>formalist</em> economic anthropolo-</p>
<p>gists who believed that a common rational logic animated all exchange, <em>sub- stantivists</em> sought to examine logics of exchange with respect to the cultural values that motivated them values to do, for example, with kinship or pres - tige (see Isaac<a href='#_page22_x47.00_y216.14'> 1993</a>).</p>
<p><code></code>e cluster of which Franklin, Landecker, Lock,  ompson, and Hayden </p>
<p>are a part, I suggest, represents a substantivism interested in the changing substances of biology. Associates of this cluster attend to matters of generativ- ity and reproduction. But they are careful not to take generativity and repro- duction as  natural laws  (as Marx did). In earlier work, Franklin, writing with Helena RagonØ <a href='#_page21_x50.00_y229.14'>(1998</a>, p. 2), cautioned against  the relegation of  reproduc - tion  to a domain of  natural  or biological facts   considered prior to, and separate  from,  sociality  an argument that echoes  an  earlier  position  in Marxist  feminist  anthropology,  in  a  piece  by  Olivia  Harris  and  Kate Young (<a href='#_page21_x50.00_y429.14'>1981</a>), entitled  Engendered structures: some problems in the analysis of reproduction , in which the authors argue against positing, as did Engels in  <em>e Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State</em>, a fundamental differ-</p>
<p>ence between reproduction and production.</p>
<p>A scholar like Sunder Rajan, meanwhile, may be read as a substantivist who looks at moral economies, joining Marxist political economy with a Weberian attention to meaning.  ough he offers clear analyses of molecular biology lab practices, he is less interested in the substances of the biological, calling atten- tion instead to the constructedness of biological facts upon which speculative exchange value is pr<a href='#_page19_x100.00_y129.14'>edicated.3</a> In <em>Biocapital</em>, he takes care not to impute any particular ontology to biological material though by not engaging the argu - ments of writers like Franklin and Lock about the new substances of  life itself  which (via such materials as stem cells) contain and morph histories of sex/gender, race, colony, and nation, he misses a chance to dig into the politics of generation and reproduction that are in the remaking in biotechnology. Together, however, Sunder Rajan s and Franklin and Lock s attention to the making of facts and the remaking of generativity can complicate such analyses as Eugene  acker s, which argues that bioengineering relies on a   molecular species being,  a species being in which labor power is cellular, enzymatic, and genetic  (<a href='#_page24_x47.00_y504.14'>2005,</a> p. 40).  at formulation is a molecular rewrite of Engels s famous 1876 reflection on   e part played by labor in the transition from ape to man , in which Engels naturalized labor, via evolutionary theory, as that process at the heart of anthropoid organisms  self-making (see Engels<a href='#_page20_x47.00_y391.14'> 1884</a>).</p>
<p>But let me cut across these substantivisms and offer a less nit-picky classifi- cation. Taking a cue from evolutionary biology, I ll pick an analogous struc- ture that operates in the bodies of all the work I ve discussed: the very concept of <em>biocapital</em> (and its similarities). Comparing how the concept fares in differ- ent bodies of work may permit us to set up a series of exchanges among them.</p>
<p>What is biocapital? My sense is this:</p>
<p>In <em>Capital</em>, Marx describes the circulation of money as capital in which </p>
<p><code></code>More money is finally withdrawn from circulation than was thrown into it at the beginning  (<a href='#_page23_x50.00_y241.14'>1867,</a> p. 251) using the formula M-C-M , where M stands </p>
<p>for money, C for commodity,   for the surplus value gained in a profitable exchange of a commodity for money, and M  for the total capital produced by that exchange. For the biotech imagination, I suggest an analogous formula to describe the making of biology into capital: B-C-B , where B stands for bio- material, C for its fashioning into a commodity through laboratory and legal instruments, and B  for the biocapital produced at the end of this process, with   the  value  added  through  the  instrumentalization  of  the  initial biomaterial.</p>
<p>What does B-C-B  look like for the theorists discussed above? How do dif- ferent species of biocapital organize the metabolic pathway that makes B into B ? What  primes  biology?</p>
<p>I have suggested that the sentiment of many biotech boosters has them imagining B  already to be latent in B to believe that biological process itself already constitutes a form of surplus value and profit production (Helmreich <a href='#_page22_x47.00_y104.14'>2007).</a>  is logic naturalizes biotech. Biological generativity is configured as accumulated labor power, the products of which can be harnessed to create productive futures.  is belief is based, it bears emphasizing, on a metaphor: that organisms are laborers (an equivalence declared even by Marx, who saw the natural consumption of eating entailing production of the body [<a href='#_page23_x50.00_y216.14'>1857 </a>58, p. 228]).  e negative image of biocapital then becomes  <em>necrocapital</em>, dead matter, like fossil fuel, put to unregenerative, zombie-like work. But we must be careful not to imagine reproduction as a transparently  natural  process, as though organisms  coming-into-being straightforwardly designates them as what Marx would have called  means of production already produced , as though their productivity is the essence of their <em>species being</em>. To see matters this way is to see organisms as natural factories or assembly lines, when in fact they only become so in certain relations. As Landecker argues, contemporary biology has become expert at stopping, starting, suspending, and accelerating cellular processes, wedging these dynamics into processes that look like a molecular version of industrial agribusiness. But biotech geese cannot lay golden eggs without daily tending.</p>
<p>What does thinking in terms of B-C-B  permit us to do? To begin, this accounting points back to Bourdieu a figure mostly absent from theories of biocapital and allows us to name how B  corresponds to economic, cultural, </p>
<p>social, and symbolic species of capital (also, in the bargain, making explicit the Darwinian, Marxist, Weberian, and Foucauldian ancestries in play in dif - ferent theorists  formulations). It could allow us to draw up a table of exchanges between different B primes, species of biocapital.</p>
<p>But to draw upon the evolutionary biology idiom once again such a classification assumes the neatness of the species concept, which is these days in crisis; recent research has seen the creation of transspecific hybrids and contemporary molecular biology has discerned thick lateral gene transfer  tangling up taxonomic boundaries almost everywhere. But more, sorting bio- capital into species has the effect of holding stable the item against which different species of biocapital exist at all namely, <em>capital</em> itself. What if we asked not what happens to biology when it is capitalized, but asked whether capital must be the sign under which all of today s encounters of the economic with the biological must travel? It is certainly the case, as medical anthropolo- gists such as Margaret Lock <a href='#_page23_x50.00_y129.14'>(2002),</a> Lawrence Cohen (<a href='#_page20_x47.00_y129.14'>2005),</a> and Leslie Sharp (<a href='#_page24_x47.00_y179.14'>2006</a>) have shown, that the circulation of organs is not in every instance overdetermined by capitalism (the fraught language of donation and traffick- ing is a giveaway). Cathy Waldby s  <em>biovalue</em>, Sarah Franklin s  <em>breedwealth</em> (<a href='#_page21_x50.00_y91.14'>1997;</a> see also Franklin <a href='#_page21_x50.00_y141.14'>2006 </a>on <em>biowealth</em>), and Donna Haraway s  <a href='#_page21_x50.00_y416.14'>2008 </a><em>encounter value</em> are germs of theory that undo the capitalocentrism of so much writing on biocapitalism and also, perhaps, the emphasis in such writing on the commodity form. Emerging social histories of  bioeconomy  looking back to early population sciences to think through political economy might </p>
<p>be another place to look for analyses that include but reach beyond capitalism (see Larsen<a href='#_page22_x47.00_y516.14'> 2005).</a> What if we imagined biovalue and bioeconomy through J. K. Gibson-Graham s  <em>e End of Capitalism (As We Knew It): A Feminist Critique of Political Economy</em> (<a href='#_page21_x50.00_y341.14'>1996), </a>which seeks to break away from the delirious reinscription of capital that happens even in its Marxist critique? What if, refusing to make capital into the coin of exchange across these con- cepts and, more, refusing to trust that exchange as such can permit the adequation of different values we found that capital itself, like the species concept, was unstable, was not so easily reproduced, or so generative, or omnipresent, after all?</p>
<p><code></code><strong>Speciating Biocapital</strong></p>
<p>In 2008, Stefan Helmreich identified two genealogies of writing on <em>biocapital</em> that examined how biological materials were being leveraged into profit- oriented undertakings: a  Marxist feminist  lineage that described change and continuity in economies of reproduction, transformations in the boundaries between nature and culture, and manipulations of biotic substance; and a  Weberian Marxist  cluster that attended to relations of production, ethical subjectivity, and economic sentiment. While some scholars have offered the <em>bioeconomy</em> (Birch and Tyfield  <a href='#_page19_x50.00_y570.14'>2013; B</a>irch <a href='#_page19_x50.00_y533.14'>2016; H</a>auskeller and Beltrame <a href='#_page21_x50.00_y491.14'>2016)</a> as a more expansive analytic, biocapital has continued to gain traction. At the same time, in the age of the post-genome, what counts as  the biologi- cal  has multiplied, with epigenetics and microbiomics, to take two examples, complicating the genetic determinism organizing early attempts to aim biol- ogy at market ends. As Hannah Landecker writes, the  economics and politics of life are changing, but so are biologies  <a href='#_page22_x47.00_y416.14'>(2016,</a> p. 44).  is postscript identi - fies four primary speciations of biocapital since 2008:</p>
<ol start='' >
<li>Into ever-more international and transnational contexts, as scholars have taken the concept into domains outside the West, often into global South, postcolonial, decolonial, and other settings.</li>
<li>Into domains concerned with biological processes beyond the scale of the genetic and cellular, reaching toward accounts of how full organisms and their  relations non-human  and  multispecies are  being  newly capitalized.</li>
<li>Into discussions of embodiment that extend feminist concerns with sex/ gender, now centering not only on such practices as IVF and stem cell sci- ence but also on different exploitative uses of human bodily, affective, reproductive, and procreative labor in sex work, in surrogacy, in domes - tic labor, and more.</li>
<li>Into  discussions  of  environments,  particularly  in  the  age  of  the Anthropocene and the moment of epigenetics and microbiomes.</li>

</ol>
<p>Biocapital is therefore no longer so centered on molecular processes iso- lated and elaborated in US or European laboratories (see Vermeulen et al. <a href='#_page25_x50.00_y79.14'>2012 </a>on  economies of life ). New trajectories reflect increased concern with non-Western  and  postcolonial  science,  multispecies  engagements,  post- genomic biology, and value beyond the economic sphere.</p>
<p><code></code><strong>Non-Western/Global South Elaborations</strong></p>
<p>Scholars have continued tracking biocapital in non-Western/global South contexts. Sunder Rajan (<a href='#_page24_x47.00_y391.14'>2012</a>) examines the  global knowledge formations  that transnational life sciences create. Aihwa Ong in <em>Fungible Life</em> (<a href='#_page23_x50.00_y366.14'>2016) </a>fol- lows scientists in Singapore s Biopolis as they make genomic information interchangeable across markets. Biopolis scientists rely on British colonial racial categories to create treatment options for what they claim to be particu- larly Asian infectious diseases and the health outcomes of Singapore s popula- tions  (see Waldby  <a href='#_page25_x50.00_y154.14'>2009 </a> on  Biopolis  as  brokering  a  utopian  vision  of  a regenerative bioeconomy  and Fischer<a href='#_page20_x47.00_y429.14'> 2013 </a>s attention to the everyday ways biosciences are employed in Singapore not only in market frames but also as tokens in cross-national science diplomacy). Moving explicitly away from genetically animated visions of biocapital, Jean-Paul Gaudilliere (<a href='#_page21_x50.00_y291.14'>2014)</a> con- siders how traditional Indian Ayurvedic knowledge is mobilized to build pharmaceutical markets, in marked distinction to the molecular paradigm that has characterized the drug industry.</p>
<p>Biocapital has also received attention in non-English-language literatures as translations of the biocapital conversation become available (Turrini <a href='#_page25_x50.00_y54.14'>2011).</a> From a study of pharmaceuticals and risk in Brazil (Rodrigues et al. <a href='#_page24_x47.00_y54.14'>2015)</a> to a  theorization  of  transspecies  reproductive  technologies  in  Italy  (Balzano <a href='#_page19_x50.00_y470.14'>2015</a>) to an investigation of the making of biocapital using biosafety scenarios in Spain (Marco et al. <a href='#_page23_x50.00_y191.14'>2015),</a> <em>biocapital</em>/<em>biocapitale</em>/<em>biocapitalismo</em> have become concepts with futures of their own, naming changing landscapes of national and transnational science, ethics, and risk.</p>
<p><code></code><strong>New Scales and Species</strong></p>
<p>Biocapital has been applied to new biotic scales and a widening range of spe- cies.  In  <em>When  Species  Meet</em>  (<a href='#_page21_x50.00_y416.14'>2008), </a> Donna  Haraway  imagines  a  Marx- equivalent  writing <em>Capital</em> today as <em>Biocapital</em>, volume 1, transcending Marx s human exceptionalism and accounting for the multispecies encounters that shape labor and commodities. To Marx s <em>use value</em> and <em>exchange value</em>, Haraway adds <em>encounter value</em>, a genre of interspecies value that, pace Gibson-Graham, does not subsume all value to the market. In  <em>e Mushroom at the End of the World</em>  (<a href='#_page24_x47.00_y554.14'>2015),</a>  Anna Tsing  attends  to  unpredictable  encounters   between humans and nonhumans in the lifeworlds of matsutake mushrooms as they are grown, gathered, and traded in spaces of  capitalist ruin. </p>
<p>Cutting-edge  biotechnologies,  such  as  the  gene-editing  technology CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), prom- ise to reorganize multispecies relations; mythical hybrids, enhanced transpe- cies,  and  programmed  extinctions  become  possible.  Eben  Kirksey  <a href='#_page22_x47.00_y316.14'>(2015</a>) reports on synthetic biologists creating bioengineered mice that may eradicate Lyme-disease-bearing  ticks  and  mosquitoes  crafted  to  blunt  the  travel  of malaria through mosquito-human populations. Scientists marry these gene- editing projects to aspirations for new  transspecific  bioeconomies; researchers claim to want to undo the proprietary secretiveness of biotech companies like Monsanto in order to make what they call  open source  and even anti-c apitalist research platforms (and see Roosth<a href='#_page24_x47.00_y91.14'> 2013)</a>.  e future of multispecies markets may transcend conventional economic exchanges of biocommodities, relying instead on minimally regulated private donor-funded projects that alter inter- species  interactions from  the  scale  of  ecosystems  down  to  organisms  genomes. Use, exchange, and encounter value may be joined by what we could call <em>transaction value</em>, where such transactions are not only about economic exchange or affective encounters but rather and also about as-yet unmarked relations of sharing, transfection, contamination, and displacement.</p>
<p><code></code><strong>Embodied Biocapital</strong></p>
<p><code></code>e feminist genealogy of thinking about biocapital has extended traditions of examining sex and gender as formations that involve biological and social reproduction, arguing that biocapital is generated from these exploitative forms  of  embodied  labor  (Happe <a href='#_page21_x50.00_y366.14'>2015</a>.  See  also  Taussig,  Hoeyer,  and Helmreich <a href='#_page24_x47.00_y479.14'>2013 </a>for an introduction to an issue of <em>Current Anthropology</em> on the new political economy of biomedical  potentialities ). Authors in this vein also  tend  to  look  to  the  global  South  as  sites  for  investigating  unequal exchanges of affect and capital. Nurul Ilmi Idrus and Anita Hardon (<a href='#_page22_x47.00_y166.14'>2015)</a> adapt the concept of biocapital to describe technologically enhanced human bodies and the relations into which they enter. In their research on sex work- ers in Indonesia, they look at how contemporary technological interventions into the bodies of sex workers and waitresses in the forms of cosmetics, psychoactive  drugs,  and  antibiotics produce  economic  power  but  also dependency. In another domain in which the well-being of bodies is at stake, David et al. (<a href='#_page20_x47.00_y279.14'>2015)</a> worry about the biocapitalization of human bodies in the context of medical aid to HIV patients.  eir study of the new industry- oriented funding philosophy of the Global Fund, a key distributor of subsi- dized  drugs  to  infected  patients  in  non-Western  countries,  raises  ethical concerns about the evaluation of bodies that are  captive  to programs that keep  them  alive  but  with  uncertain  future  commitments  and  treatment policies.</p>
<p>Kalinda Vora (<a href='#_page25_x50.00_y104.14'>2015</a>) focuses on the unidirectional movement from India to the United States of the  vital energy  produced by human labor in gesta- tional surrogacies, call centers, domestic labor, and more. As affective and reproductive labor are commoditized and outsourced, human biocapital from India supports life in the United States, producing new socialities alongside economic value (see Murphy <a href='#_page23_x50.00_y354.14'>2017 </a>for an historical analysis of rubrics that quantify the cost and value of populations).</p>
<p><code></code><strong>Environments</strong></p>
<p>In the era now marked as the Anthropocene, in which human activities have irrevocably degraded the livable world, Anthropocenic concerns increasingly drive the development of new biologically derived commodities, as biocapi- talist  forms  define  interventions,  solutions,  and  ethics  related  to  social- ecological problems. Nicole Shukin (<a href='#_page24_x47.00_y216.14'>2016)</a> looks to a group of Fukushima residents who defied government orders to evacuate as a way to evaluate  resil- ience  as an embodied biocapitalist resource, one that is  consciously culti- vated  and  valorized  by  corporate  and  state  institutions   that  benefit economically from populations  ability to manage life amid disaster condi- tions. Here are entwined human biocapital, resource extraction, and eco- nomic imperatives, oriented toward an activist, anti-capitalist politics in a technologically mediated landscape (see also Acero<a href='#_page19_x50.00_y383.14'> 2012 </a>on environment, gender, and  citizen controlled  biotechnology).</p>
<p>Concomitant with new understandings of the role of humans in making environments come post-genomic research agendas that see extracellular fac- tors playing crucial roles in shaping biologies (Richardson and Stevens<a href='#_page23_x50.00_y529.14'> 2015).</a> Parallel to CRISPR s genetic reductionism are postgenomic biologies such as epigenetics (Landecker and Panofsky <a href='#_page22_x47.00_y479.14'>2013;</a> Meloni and Testa <a href='#_page23_x50.00_y279.14'>2014),</a> genres of life science that modulate assumptions of genetic fixity to account for how organic and social forces combine to render  the biological  plastic and porous to  the environment  and to history (Landecker<a href='#_page22_x47.00_y416.14'> 2016).</a>  ink, for example, of how our very food bears  the traces of scientific and economic rationalizations of plant and animal bodies  (Stassart<a href='#_page24_x47.00_y266.14'> 2003:</a> 449), a dynamic that brings earlier bioeconomies into the multicellular, metabolic processes of today s popula- tions (and that in turn has been narrated in ways that suggest that economic theorizations and measures of human biological life chances may be reani- mated in light of new biologies; see Almond and Janet <a href='#_page19_x50.00_y433.14'>2011;</a> Pentecost <a href='#_page23_x50.00_y391.14'>2016 </a>and see Meloni and Testa  <a href='#_page23_x50.00_y279.14'>2014 </a>on new attempts to capitalize epigenetic understandings of nutrition).  Environment  global, bodily is coming to matter in new ways as scholars investigate research on the factors that influ- ence biological, social, and economic outcomes (Heckman <a href='#_page21_x50.00_y554.14'>2007).</a></p>
<p>If the concept of  species  is becoming ever more ontologically unstable, so are  species  of biocapital, edited and spliced into more heterogeneous social, political, and economic relations. As scholars have shown, biocapitalist forms and operations increasingly rely on the intracellular/intraecological exchanges, encounters, transactions, and drives that biotechnologies make possible. Most contemporary  biocapital  emerges  from  exploitative,  neoliberal  models  of commodification and circulation trans-infecting biologies, ideologies, and markets from the inside out. And as post-genomics, environmental remedia- tion, climate change amelioration, global disease eradication, and resource scarcity motivate new biological research platforms, biocapital will see new </p>
<p>inventions, edits, contaminations, and wirings, yielding new species of bio- capital for scholars to probe critically.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ol start='' >
<li>For Aristotle, <em>generativity</em> was such an essential property of nature that he saw the application of its logic to the artifice of exchange as an ethical problem. In <em>Politics</em> , he wrote,  Currency was intended to be a means of exchange, whereas interest represents an increase in the currency itself. Hence its name [<em>Tokos</em> ( offspring )] for each animal produces its like, and interest is currency born of currency. And so of all types of business this is the most contrary to nature  (I x 1258a27) (<a href='#_page19_x50.00_y458.14'>1981).</a> Martin Luther had a similar view:  I do not understand how a hundred guilders can make twenty profit in a single year, or even one guilder make another. Nothing like this takes place by cultivating the soil, or by raising cattle, where the increase does not depend on human wits, but on God s blessing  <a href='#_page23_x50.00_y154.14'>(1961 </a>[<a href='#_page23_x50.00_y154.14'>1520],</a> p. 482).</li>
<li>e tree representation overlooks important mechanisms and vehicles for the travel of concepts. It leaves out the lateral transfections and endosymbiotic fusions consequent on classes taken, conference papers heard, drafts circulated, and readers  reports rendered (Rabinow started giving a biosociality talk in 1990; Fortun was speaking on  Projecting Speed Genomics  as early as 1994;  ompson s notion of the promissory circulated at a 2000 conference; and Sunder Rajan s dissertation, with the same title as his book, was finished in 2002, etc.). It also leaves out the fact that authors  positions change over time.Any model of the inheritance of properties would also map out a story of the transmission of what Bourdieu called <em>academic capital</em> (with credit and credibility not far behind see Latour and Woolgar s (<a href='#_page22_x47.00_y541.14'>1986, p</a>. 201) circle dia- gram of cycles of conversion between types of capital, in which recognition  grant   money   equipment   data   arguments   articles   recogni- tion   and so on ).</li>
<li>Compare social theorists of finance as far back as Gabriel Tarde, who in 1902 looked to organic metaphors to think through capital as a relationship between potentialities of invention and accumulation. Tarde developed the metaphors of <em>germ capital</em> and <em>cotyledon capital</em> to account for the origin and maintenance </li>

</ol>
<p>of capital not exclusively in accumulated labor but in ratios of difference and repetition realized in reproduction and production imagined as contingent col- laborations of human, machine, and nature (LØpinay<a href='#_page23_x50.00_y79.14'> 2007b</a>). Complicating another biological metaphor in social studies of money, the work of Vincent- Antonin LØpinay <a href='#_page23_x50.00_y54.14'>(2007a</a>) critiques the notion that financial formula packages such as Capital Guarantee Products are  parasitic  on the industrial goods to which they putatively refer, arguing that such products circulate in the same sphere of valuation as the  organisms  to which they are calibrated. Such a cri- tique of how  parasitism  is employed to describe derivative financial instru- ments  could  be  extended  to  direct  attention  to  the  parasite  metaphor s anti-Semitic resonances in the history of finance in the West (particularly in characterizations of lending money at interest) (see Raffles<a href='#_page23_x50.00_y491.14'> 2007</a>).</p>
