<li>The essay distances itself from traditional accounts of sovereignty found in the discipline of</li>

</ol>
<p>political science and the subdiscipline of international relations. For the most part, these accounts locate sovereignty within the boundaries of the nation-state, within institutions empowered by the state, or within supranational institutions and networks. See, for example, <em>Sovereignty at the Millen- nium</em>, special issue, <em>Political Studies</em>47 (1999). My own approach builds on Michel Foucault’s critique of the notion of sovereignty and its relation to war and biopower in <em>Il faut défendre la société: Cours au Collège de France, 1975–1976</em> (Paris: Seuil, 1997), 37–55, 75–100, 125–48, 213–44.

<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> fundamental attributes. To exercise sovereignty is to exercise control over mor-</p>
<p>tality and to de  ne life as the deployment and manifestation of power.</p>
<p>One could summarize in the above terms what Michel Foucault meant by <em>biopower</em>: that domain of life over which power has taken control.2 But under what practical conditions is the right to kill, to allow to live, or to expose to death exercised? Who is the subject of this right? What does the implementation of such a right tell us about the person who is thus put to death and about the relation of enmity that sets that person against his or her murderer? Is the notion of biopower suf  cient to account for the contemporary ways in which the political, under the guise of war, of resistance, or of the   ght against terror, makes the mur- der of the enemy its primary and absolute objective? War, after all, is as much a means of achieving sovereignty as a way of exercising the right to kill. Imagining politics as a form of war, we must ask: What place is given to life, death, and the human body (in particular the wounded or slain body)? How are they inscribed in the order of power?</p>
<p><strong>Politics,the Work of Death,and the “Becoming Subject”</strong></p>
<p>In order to answer these questions, this essay draws on the concept of biopower and explores its relation to notions of sovereignty (<em>imperium</em>) and the state of excep- tion.3 Such an analysis raises a number of empirical and philosophical questions I would like to examine brie  y. As is well known, the concept of the state of excep- tion has been often discussed in relation to Nazism, totalitarianism, and the con- centration/extermination camps. The death camps in particular have been inter- preted variously as the central metaphor for sovereign and destructive violence and as the ultimate sign of the absolute power of the negative. Says Hannah Arendt: “There are no parallels to the life in the concentration camps. Its horror can never be fully embraced by the imagination for the very reason that it stands outside of life and death.”4 Because its inhabitants are divested of political status and reduced to bare life, the camp is, for Giorgio Agamben, “the place in which the most absolute <em>conditio inhumana</em>ever to appear on Earth was realized.”5 In the political-juridical structure of the camp, he adds, the state of exception ceases to be a temporal sus-</p>

<p>The aim of this essay is not to debate the singularity of the extermination of the</p>
<p>Jews or to hold it up by way of example.6 I start from the idea that modernity was</p>
<p>at the origin of multiple concepts of sovereignty—and therefore of the biopoliti-</p>
<p>cal. Disregarding this multiplicity, late-modern political criticism has unfortu-</p>
<p>nately privileged normative theories of democracy and has made the concept of</p>
<p>reason one of the most important elements of both the project of modernity and of</p>
<p>the topos of sovereignty.7 From this perspective, the ultimate expression of sover-</p>
<p>eignty is the production of general norms by a body (the demos) made up of free</p>
<p>and equal men and women. These men and women are posited as full subjects</p>
<p>capable of self-understanding, self-consciousness, and self-representation. Poli-</p>
<p>tics, therefore, is de  ned as twofold: a project of autonomy and the achieving of</p>
<p>agreement among a collectivity through communication and recognition. This, we</p>
<p>are told, is what differentiates it from war.8</p>
<p>In other words, it is on the basis of a distinction between reason and unreason</p>
<p>(passion, fantasy) that late-modern criticism has been able to articulate a certain</p>
<p>idea of the political, the community, the subject—or, more fundamentally, of</p>
<p>what the good life is all about, how to achieve it, and, in the process, to become a</p>
<p>fully moral agent. Within this paradigm, reason is the truth of the subject and pol-</p>
<p>itics is the exercise of reason in the public sphere. The exercise of reason is tan-</p>
<p>tamount to the exercise of freedom, a key element for individual autonomy. The</p>
<p>romance of sovereignty, in this case, rests on the belief that the subject is the</p>
<p>master and the controlling author of his or her own meaning. Sovereignty is</p>
<p>therefore de  ned as a twofold process of <em>self-institution</em>and <em>self-limitation</em>(  x-</p>
<p>ing one’s own limits for oneself). The exercise of sovereignty, in turn, consists in</p>
<p>society’s capacity for self-creation through recourse to institutions inspired by</p>
<p>speci  c social and imaginary signi  cations.9</p>
<p>This strongly normative reading of the politics of sovereignty has been the</p>

<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> object of numerous critiques, which I will not rehearse here.10 My concern is</p>
<p>those   gures of sovereignty whose central project is not the struggle for auton- omy but <em>the generalized instrumentalization of human existence and the material destruction of human bodies and populations</em>. Such   gures of sovereignty are far from a piece of prodigious insanity or an expression of a rupture between the impulses and interests of the body and those of the mind. Indeed, they, like the death camps, are what constitute the <em>nomos</em> of the political space in which we still live. Furthermore, contemporary experiences of human destruction suggest that it is possible to develop a reading of politics, sovereignty, and the subject dif- ferent from the one we inherited from the philosophical discourse of modernity. Instead of considering reason as the truth of the subject, we can look to other foundational categories that are less abstract and more tactile, such as life and death.</p>
<p>Signi  cant for such a project is Hegel’s discussion of the relation between death and the “becoming subject.” Hegel’s account of death centers on a bipartite concept of negativity. First, the human negates nature (a negation exteriorized in the human’s effort to reduce nature to his or her own needs); and second, he or she transforms the negated element through work and struggle. In transforming nature, the human being creates a world; but in the process, he or she also is exposed to his or her own negativity. Within the Hegelian paradigm, human death is essentially voluntary. It is the result of risks consciously assumed by the subject. According to Hegel, in these risks the “animal” that constitutes the human subject’s natural being is defeated.</p>
<p>In other words, the human being truly <em>becomes a subject</em>—that is, separated from the animal—in the struggle and the work through which he or she con- fronts death (understood as the violence of negativity). It is through this con- frontation with death that he or she is cast into the incessant movement of history. Becoming subject therefore supposes upholding the work of death. To uphold the work of death is precisely how Hegel de  nes the life of the Spirit. The life of the Spirit, he says, is not that life which is frightened of death, and spares itself destruction, but that life which assumes death and lives with it. Spirit attains its truth only by   nding itself in absolute dismemberment.11 Politics is therefore</p>

<p>death that lives a human life. Such, too, is the de  nition of absolute knowledge <strong>Necropolitics</strong> and sovereignty: risking the entirety of one’s life.</p>
<p>Georges Bataille also offers critical insights into how death structures the idea</p>
<p>of sovereignty, the political, and the subject. Bataille displaces Hegel’s concep-</p>
<p>tion of the linkages between death, sovereignty, and the subject in at least three</p>
<p>ways. First, he interprets death and sovereignty as the paroxysm of exchange and</p>
<p>superabundance—or, to use his own terminology: <em>excess</em>. For Bataille, life is</p>
<p>defective only when death has taken it hostage. Life itself exists only in bursts</p>
<p>and in exchange with death.12 He argues that death is the putrefaction of life, the</p>
<p>stench that is at once the source and the repulsive condition of life. Therefore,</p>
<p>although it destroys what was to be, obliterates what was supposed to continue</p>
<p>being, and reduces to nothing the individual who takes it, death does not come</p>
<p>down to the pure annihilation of being. Rather, it is essentially self-consciousness;</p>
<p>moreover, it is the most luxurious form of life, that is, of effusion and exuber-</p>
<p>ance: a power of proliferation. Even more radically, Bataille withdraws death</p>
<p>from the horizon of meaning. This is in contrast to Hegel, for whom nothing is</p>
<p>de  nitively lost in death; indeed, death is seen as holding great signi  cation as a</p>
<p>means to truth.</p>
<p>Second, Bataille   rmly anchors death in the realm of <em>absolute expenditure</em>(the other characteristic of sovereignty), whereas Hegel tries to keep death within the economy of absolute knowledge and meaning. Life beyond utility, says Bataille, is the domain of sovereignty. This being the case, death is therefore the point at which destruction, suppression, and sacri  ce constitute so irreversible and radical an expenditure—an expenditure without reserve—that they can no longer be determined as negativity. Death is therefore the very principle of excess—an <em>anti-economy</em>. Hence the metaphor of luxury and of <em>the luxurious character of death.</em></p>
<p>Third, Bataille establishes a correlation among death, sovereignty, and sexu- ality. Sexuality is inextricably linked to violence and to the dissolution of the boundaries of the body and self by way of orgiastic and excremental impulses. As such, sexuality concerns two major forms of polarized human impulses—excre- tion and appropriation—as well as the regime of the taboos surrounding them.13 The truth of sex and its deadly attributes reside in the experience of loss of the boundaries separating reality, events, and fantasized objects. </p>

<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> For Bataille, sovereignty therefore has many forms. But ultimately it is the refusal to accept the limits that the fear of death would have the subject respect.</p>
<p>The sovereign world, Bataille argues, “is the world in which the limit of death is done away with. Death is present in it, its presence de  nes that world of violence, but while death is present it is always there only to be negated, never for anything but that. The sovereign,” he concludes, “is he who is, as if death were not. . . . He has no more regard for the limits of identity than he does for limits of death, or rather these limits are the same; he is the transgression of all such limits.” Since the natural domain of prohibitions includes death, among others (e.g., sexuality,   lth, excrement), sovereignty requires “the strength to violate the prohibition against killing, although it’s true this will be under the conditions that customs de  ne.” And contrary to subordination that is always rooted in necessity and the</p>
<p>alleged need to avoid death, sovereignty de  nitely calls for the risk of death.14 By treating sovereignty as the violation of prohibitions, Bataille reopens the question of the limits of the political. Politics, in this case, is not the forward dialectical movement of reason. Politics can only be traced as a spiral transgres- sion, as that difference that disorients the very idea of the limit. More speci  cally,</p>
<p>politics is the difference put into play by the violation of a taboo.15</p>
<p><strong>Biopower and the Relation of Enmity</strong></p>
<p>Having presented a reading of politics as the work of death, I turn now to sover- eignty, expressed predominantly as the right to kill. For the purpose of my argu- ment, I relate Foucault’s notion of biopower to two other concepts: the state of exception and the state of siege.16 I examine those trajectories by which the state of exception and the relation of enmity have become the normative basis of the right to kill. In such instances, power (and not necessarily state power) con- tinuously refers and appeals to exception, emergency, and a   ctionalized notion of the enemy. It also labors to produce that same exception, emergency, and   c- tionalized enemy. In other words, the question is: What is the relationship between politics and death in those systems that can function only in a state of emergency?</p>
<p>In Foucault’s formulation of it, biopower appears to function through dividing</p>

<p>people into those who must live and those who must die. Operating on the basis <strong>Necropolitics</strong> of a split between the living and the dead, such a power de  nes itself in relation</p>
<p>to a biological   eld—which it takes control of and vests itself in. This control</p>
<p>presupposes the distribution of human species into groups, the subdivision of the</p>
<p>population into subgroups, and the establishment of a biological caesura between</p>
<p>the ones and the others. This is what Foucault labels with the (at   rst sight famil-</p>
<p>iar) term <em>racism</em>.17</p>
<p>That <em>race</em> (or for that matter <em>racism</em>)   gures so prominently in the calculus of</p>
<p>biopower is entirely justi  able. After all, more so than class-thinking (the ideol-</p>
<p>ogy that de  nes history as an economic struggle of classes), race has been the</p>
<p>ever present shadow in Western political thought and practice, especially when it</p>
<p>comes to imagining the inhumanity of, or rule over, foreign peoples. Referring to</p>
<p>both this ever-presence and the phantomlike world of race in general, Arendt</p>
<p>locates their roots in the shattering experience of otherness and suggests that the</p>
<p>politics of race is ultimately linked to the politics of death.18 Indeed, in Foucault’s</p>
<p>terms, racism is above all a technology aimed at permitting the exercise of</p>
<p>biopower, “that old sovereign right of death.”19 In the economy of biopower, the</p>
<p>function of racism is to regulate the distribution of death and to make possible the</p>
<p>murderous functions of the state. It is, he says, “the condition for the acceptabil-</p>
<p>ity of putting to death.”20</p>
<p>Foucault states clearly that the sovereign right to kill (<em>droit de glaive</em>) and the</p>
<p>mechanisms of biopower are inscribed in the way all modern states function;21</p>
<p>indeed, they can be seen as constitutive elements of state power in modernity.</p>
<p>According to Foucault, the Nazi state was the most complete example of a state</p>
<p>exercising the right to kill. This state, he claims, made the management, protec-</p>
<p>tion, and cultivation of life coextensive with the sovereign right to kill. By bio-</p>
<p>logical extrapolation on the theme of the political enemy, in organizing the war</p>
<p>against its adversaries and, at the same time, exposing its own citizens to war, the</p>
<p>Nazi state is seen as having opened the way for a formidable consolidation of the</p>
<p>right to kill, which culminated in the project of the “  nal solution.” In doing so, it</p>
<p>became the archetype of a power formation that combined the characteristics of</p>
<p>the racist state, the murderous state, and the suicidal state.</p>

<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> It has been argued that the complete con  ation of war and politics (and racism,</p>
<p>homicide, and suicide), until they are indistinguishable from one another, is unique to the Nazi state. The perception of the existence of the Other as an attempt on my life, as a mortal threat or absolute danger whose biophysical elimination would strengthen my potential to life and security—this, I suggest, is one of the many imaginaries of sovereignty characteristic of both early and late modernity itself. Recognition of this perception to a large extent underpins most traditional cri- tiques of modernity, whether they are dealing with nihilism and its proclamation of the will for power as the essence of the being; with rei  cation understood as the <em>becoming-object</em> of the human being; or the subordination of everything to impersonal logic and to the reign of calculability and instrumental rationality.22 Indeed, from an anthropological perspective, what these critiques implicitly con- test is a de  nition of politics as the warlike relation par excellence. They also challenge the idea that, of necessity, the calculus of life passes through the death of the Other; or that sovereignty consists of the will and the capacity to kill in order to live.</p>
<p>Taking a historical perspective, a number of analysts have argued that the material premises of Nazi extermination are to be found in colonial imperialism on the one hand and, on the other, in the serialization of technical mechanisms for putting people to death—mechanisms developed between the Industrial Revolu- tion and the First World War. According to Enzo Traverso, the gas chambers and the ovens were the culmination of a long process of dehumanizing and industri- alizing death, one of the original features of which was to integrate instrumental rationality with the productive and administrative rationality of the modern West- ern world (the factory, the bureaucracy, the prison, the army). Having become mechanized, serialized execution was transformed into a purely technical, imper- sonal, silent, and rapid procedure. This development was aided in part by racist stereotypes and the   ourishing of a class-based racism that, in translating the social con  icts of the industrial world in racial terms, ended up comparing the working classes and “stateless people” of the industrial world to the “savages” of the colonial world.23</p>
<p>In reality, the links between modernity and terror spring from multiple sources. Some are to be found in the political practices of the ancien régime. From this perspective, the tension between the public’s passion for blood and notions of jus-</p>

<p>tice and revenge is critical. Foucault shows in <em>Discipline and Punish</em>how the exe- <strong>Necropolitics</strong> cution of the would-be regicide Damiens went on for hours, much to the satisfac-</p>
<p>tion of the crowd.24 Well known is the long procession of the condemned through</p>
<p>the streets prior to execution, the parade of body parts—a ritual that became a</p>
<p>standard feature of popular violence—and the   nal display of a severed head</p>
<p>mounted on a pike. In France, the advent of the guillotine marks a new phase in</p>
<p>the “democratization” of the means of disposing of the enemies of the state.</p>
<p>Indeed, this form of execution that had once been the prerogative of the nobility</p>
<p>is extended to all citizens. In a context in which decapitation is viewed as less</p>
<p>demeaning than hanging, innovations in the technologies of murder aim not only</p>
<p>at “civilizing” the ways of killing. They also aim at disposing of a large number of</p>
<p>victims in a relatively short span of time. At the same time, a new cultural sensi-</p>
<p>bility emerges in which killing the enemy of the state is an extension of play.</p>
<p>More intimate, lurid, and leisurely forms of cruelty appear.</p>
<p>But nowhere is the con  ation of reason and terror so manifest as during the</p>
<p>French Revolution.25 During the French Revolution, terror is construed as an</p>
<p>almost necessary part of politics. An absolute transparency is claimed to exist</p>
<p>between the state and the people. As a political category, “the people” is gradu-</p>
<p>ally displaced from concrete reality to rhetorical   gure. As David Bates has</p>
<p>shown, the theorists of terror believe it possible to distinguish between authentic</p>
<p>expressions of sovereignty and the actions of the enemy. They also believe it pos-</p>
<p>sible to distinguish between the “error” of the citizen and the “crime” of the coun-</p>
<p>terrevolutionary in the political sphere. Terror thus becomes a way of marking</p>
<p>aberration in the body politic, and politics is read both as the mobile force of rea-</p>
<p>son and as the errant attempt at creating a space where “error” would be reduced,</p>
<p>truth enhanced, and the enemy disposed of.26</p>
<p>Finally, terror is not linked solely to the utopian belief in the unfettered power</p>
<p>of human reason. It is also clearly related to various narratives of mastery and</p>
<p>emancipation, most of which are underpinned by Enlightenment understandings</p>
<p>of truth and error, the “real” and the symbolic. Marx, for example, con  ates labor</p>
<p>(the endless cycle of production and consumption required for the maintenance</p>
<p>of human life) with work (the creation of lasting artifacts that add to the world of</p>
<p>things). Labor is viewed as the vehicle for the historical self-creation of humankind.</p>

<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> The historical self-creation of humankind is itself a life-and-death con  ict, that</p>
<p>is, a con  ict over what paths should lead to the truth of history: the overcoming of capitalism and the commodity form and the contradictions associated with both. According to Marx, with the advent of communism and the abolition of exchange relations, things will appear as they really are; the “real” will present itself as it actually is, and the distinction between subject and object or being and consciousness will be transcended.27 But by making human emancipation depen- dent upon the abolition of commodity production, Marx blurs the all-important divisions among the man-made realm of freedom, the nature-determined realm of necessity, and the contingent in history.</p>
<p>The commitment to the abolition of commodity production and the dream of direct and unmediated access to the “real” make these processes—the ful  llment of the so-called logic of history and the fabrication of humankind—almost nec- essarily violent processes. As shown by Stephen Louw, the central tenets of clas- sical Marxism leave no choice but to “try to introduce communism by adminis- trative   at, which, in practice, means that social relations must be decommodi  ed forcefully.”28 Historically, these attempts have taken such forms as labor milita- rization, the collapse of the distinction between state and society, and revolution- ary terror.29 It may be argued that they aimed at the eradication of the basic human condition of plurality. Indeed, the overcoming of class divisions, the with- ering away of the state, the   owering of a truly general will presuppose a view of human plurality as the chief obstacle to the eventual realization of a predeter- mined telos of history. In other words, the subject of Marxian modernity is, fun- damentally, a subject who is intent on proving his or her sovereignty through the staging of a   ght to the death. Just as with Hegel, the narrative of mastery and emancipation here is clearly linked to a narrative of truth and death. Terror and killing become the means of realizing the already known telos of history.</p>

<p>Any historical account of the rise of modern terror needs to address slavery, <strong>Necropolitics</strong> which could be considered one of the   rst instances of biopolitical experimenta-</p>
<p>tion. In many respects, the very structure of the plantation system and its after-</p>
<p>math manifests the emblematic and paradoxical   gure of the state of exception.30</p>
<p>This   gure is paradoxical here for two reasons. First, in the context of the plan-</p>
<p>tation, the humanity of the slave appears as the perfect   gure of a shadow. Indeed,</p>
<p>the slave condition results from a triple loss: loss of a “home,” loss of rights over</p>
<p>his or her body, and loss of political status. This triple loss is identical with absolute</p>
<p>domination, natal alienation, and social death (expulsion from humanity altogether).</p>
<p>To be sure, as a political-juridical structure, the plantation is a space where the</p>
<p>slave belongs to a master. It is not a community if only because by de  nition, a</p>
<p>community implies the exercise of the power of speech and thought. As Paul</p>
<p>Gilroy says, “The extreme patterns of communication de  ned by the institution</p>
<p>of plantation slavery dictate that we recognize the anti-discursive and extralin-</p>
<p>guistic rami  cations of power at work in shaping communicative acts. There</p>
<p>may, after all, be no reciprocity on the plantation outside of the possibilities of</p>
<p>rebellion and suicide,   ight and silent mourning, and there is certainly no gram-</p>
<p>matical unity of speech to mediate communicative reason. In many respects, the</p>
<p>plantation inhabitants live non-synchronously.”31 As an instrument of labor, the</p>
<p>slave has a price. As a property, he or she has a value. His or her labor is needed</p>
<p>and used. The slave is therefore kept alive but in a <em>state of injury</em>, in a phantom-</p>
<p>like world of horrors and intense cruelty and profanity. The violent tenor of the</p>
<p>slave’s life is manifested through the overseer’s disposition to behave in a cruel</p>
<p>and intemperate manner and in the spectacle of pain in  icted on the slave’s</p>
<p>body.32 Violence, here, becomes an element in manners,33 like whipping or taking</p>
<p>of the slave’s life itself: an act of caprice and pure destruction aimed at instilling</p>
<p>terror.34 Slave life, in many ways, is a form of death-in-life. As Susan Buck-</p>

<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> Morss has suggested, the slave condition produces a contradiction between free-</p>
<p>dom of property and freedom of person. An unequal relationship is established along with the inequality of the power over life. This power over the life of another takes the form of commerce: a person’s humanity is dissolved to the point where it becomes possible to say that the slave’s life is possessed by the master.35 Because the slave’s life is like a “thing,” possessed by another person, the slave existence appears as a perfect   gure of a shadow.</p>
<p>In spite of the terror and the symbolic sealing off of the slave, he or she main- tains alternative perspectives toward time, work, and self. This is the second paradoxical element of the plantation world as a manifestation of the state of exception. Treated as if he or she no longer existed except as a mere tool and instrument of production, the slave nevertheless is able to draw almost any object, instrument, language, or gesture into a performance and then stylize it. Breaking with uprootedness and the pure world of things of which he or she is but a frag- ment, the slave is able to demonstrate the protean capabilities of the human bond through music and the very body that was supposedly possessed by another.36</p>
<p>If the relations between life and death, the politics of cruelty, and the symbol- ics of profanity are blurred in the plantation system, it is notably in the colony and under the apartheid regime that there comes into being a peculiar terror for- mation I will now turn to.<sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-1' name='ref-footnote-1'>1</a></sup> The most original feature of this terror formation is its concatenation of biopower, the state of exception, and the state of siege.

<p>selection of races, the prohibition of mixed marriages, forced sterilization, even <strong>Necropolitics</strong> the extermination of vanquished peoples are to   nd their   rst testing ground in</p>
<p>the colonial world. Here we see the   rst syntheses between massacre and bureau-</p>
<p>cracy, that incarnation of Western rationality.39 Arendt develops the thesis that</p>
<p>there is a link between national-socialism and traditional imperialism. According</p>
<p>to her, the colonial conquest revealed a potential for violence previously unknown.</p>
<p>What one witnesses in World War II is the extension to the “civilized” peoples of</p>
<p>Europe of the methods previously reserved for the “savages.”</p>
<p>That the technologies which ended up producing Nazism should have origi-</p>
<p>nated in the plantation or in the colony or that, on the contrary—Foucault’s the-</p>
<p>sis—Nazism and Stalinism did no more than amplify a series of mechanisms that</p>
<p>already existed in Western European social and political formations (subjugation</p>
<p>of the body, health regulations, social Darwinism, eugenics, medico-legal theo-</p>
<p>ries on heredity, degeneration, and race) is, in the end, irrelevant. A fact remains,</p>
<p>though: in modern philosophical thought and European political practice and</p>
<p>imaginary, the colony represents the site where sovereignty consists fundamen-</p>
<p>tally in the exercise of a power outside the law (<em>ab legibus solutus</em>) and where</p>
<p>“peace” is more likely to take on the face of a “war without end.”</p>
<p>Indeed, such a view corresponds to Carl Schmitt’s de  nition of sovereignty at</p>
<p>the beginning of the twentieth century, namely, the power to decide on the state of</p>
<p>exception. To properly assess the ef  cacy of the colony as a formation of terror,</p>
<p>we need to take a detour into the European imaginary itself as it relates to the crit-</p>
<p>ical issue of the domestication of war and the creation of a European juridical</p>
<p>order (<em>Jus publicum Europaeum</em>). At the basis of this order were two key prin-</p>
<p>ciples. The   rst postulated the juridical equality of all states. This equality was</p>
<p>notably applied to <em>the right to wage war</em>(the taking of life). The right to war meant</p>
<p>two things. On the one hand, to kill or to conclude peace was recognized as one of</p>
<p>the preeminent functions of any state. It went hand in hand with the recognition</p>
<p>of the fact that no state could make claims to rule outside of its borders. But con-</p>
<p>versely, the state could recognize no authority above it within its own borders. On</p>
<p>the other hand, the state, for its part, undertook to “civilize” the ways of killing</p>
<p>and to attribute rational objectives to the very act of killing.</p>
<p>The second principle related to the territorialization of the sovereign state, that is, to the determination of its frontiers within the context of a newly imposed global order. In this context, the <em>Jus publicum</em>rapidly assumed the form of a dis- tinction between, on the one hand, those parts of the globe available for colonial</p>
<ol start='39' >
<li>Arendt, <em>Origins of Totalitarianism</em>, 185–221.</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> appropriation and, on the other, Europe itself (where the <em>Jus publicum</em> was to</p>
<p>hold sway).40 This distinction, as we will see, is crucial in terms of assessing the ef  cacy of the colony as a terror formation. Under <em>Jus publicum</em>, a legitimate war is, to a large extent, a war conducted by one state against another or, more pre- cisely, a war between “civilized” states. The centrality of the state in the calculus of war derives from the fact that the state is the model of political unity, a princi- ple of rational organization, the embodiment of the idea of the universal, and a moral sign.</p>
<p>In the same context, colonies are similar to the frontiers. They are inhabited by “savages.” The colonies are not organized in a state form and have not created a human world. Their armies do not form a distinct entity, and their wars are not wars between regular armies. They do not imply the mobilization of sovereign subjects (citizens) who respect each other as enemies. They do not establish a dis- tinction between combatants and noncombatants, or again between an “enemy” and a “criminal.”41 It is thus impossible to conclude peace with them. In sum, colonies are zones in which war and disorder, internal and external   gures of the political, stand side by side or alternate with each other. As such, the colonies are the location par excellence where the controls and guarantees of judicial order can be suspended—the zone where the violence of the state of exception is deemed to operate in the service of “civilization.”</p>
<p>That colonies might be ruled over in absolute lawlessness stems from the racial denial of any common bond between the conqueror and the native. In the eyes of the conqueror, <em>savage life</em> is just another form of <em>animal life</em>, a horrifying experience, something alien beyond imagination or comprehension. In fact, accord- ing to Arendt, what makes the savages different from other human beings is less the color of their skin than the fear that they behave like a part of nature, that they treat nature as their undisputed master. Nature thus remains, in all its majesty, an overwhelming reality compared to which they appear to be phantoms, unreal and ghostlike. The savages are, as it were, “natural” human beings who lack the speci  cally human character, the speci  cally human reality, “so that when Euro- pean men massacred them they somehow were not aware that they had commit-</p>
<p>ted murder.”42</p>

<p>For all the above reasons, the sovereign right to kill is not subject to any rule <strong>Necropolitics</strong> in the colonies. In the colonies, the sovereign might kill at any time or in any</p>
<p>manner. Colonial warfare is not subject to legal and institutional rules. It is not a</p>
<p>legally codi  ed activity. Instead, colonial terror constantly intertwines with colo-</p>
<p>nially generated fantasies of wilderness and death and   ctions to create the effect</p>
<p>of the real.43 Peace is not necessarily the natural outcome of a colonial war. In</p>
<p>fact, the distinction between war and peace does not avail. Colonial wars are con-</p>
<p>ceived of as the expression of an absolute hostility that sets the conqueror against</p>
<p>an absolute enemy.44 All manifestations of war and hostility that had been mar-</p>

<p>Here, the   ction of a distinction between “the ends of war” and the “means of</p>
<p>war” collapses; so does the   ction that war functions as a rule-governed contest,</p>
<p>as opposed to pure slaughter without risk or instrumental justi  cation. It becomes</p>
<p>futile, therefore, to attempt to resolve one of the intractable paradoxes of war</p>
<p>well captured by Alexandre Kojève in his reinterpretation of Hegel’s <em>Phenome-</em></p>
<p><em>nology of the Spirit</em>: its simultaneous idealism and apparent inhumanity.45</p>
<p><strong>Necropower and Late Modern Colonial Occupation</strong></p>
<p>It might be thought that the ideas developed above relate to a distant past. In the past, indeed, imperial wars did have the objective of destroying local powers, installing troops, and instituting new models of military control over civil popu- lations. A group of local auxiliaries could assist in the management of conquered territories annexed to the empire. Within the empire, the vanquished populations were given a status that enshrined their despoilment. In these con  gurations, vio- lence constituted the original form of the right, and exception provided the struc- ture of sovereignty. Each stage of imperialism also involved certain key tech- nologies (the gunboat, quinine, steamship lines, submarine telegraph cables, and colonial railroads).46</p>
<p><em>Colonial occupation</em> itself was a matter of seizing, delimiting, and asserting control over a physical geographical area—of writing on the ground a new set of social and spatial relations. The writing of new spatial relations (territorializa-</p>

<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> tion) was, ultimately, tantamount to the production of boundaries and hierarchies, zones and enclaves; the subversion of existing property arrangements; the clas-</p>
<p>si  cation of people according to different categories; resource extraction; and,   nally, the manufacturing of a large reservoir of cultural imaginaries. These imaginaries gave meaning to the enactment of differential rights to differing cat- egories of people for different purposes within the same space; in brief, the exer- cise of sovereignty. Space was therefore the raw material of sovereignty and the violence it carried with it. Sovereignty meant occupation, and occupation meant relegating the colonized into a third zone between subjecthood and objecthood. Such was the case of the apartheid regime in South Africa. Here, the <em>township</em> was the structural form and the <em>homelands</em> became the reserves (rural bases) whereby the   ow of migrant labor could be regulated and African urbanization held in check.47 As Belinda Bozzoli has shown, the township in particular was a place where “severe oppression and poverty were experienced on a racial and class basis.”48 A sociopolitical, cultural, and economic formation, the township was a peculiar spatial institution scienti  cally planned for the purposes of con- trol.49 The functioning of the homelands and townships entailed severe restric- tions on production for the market by blacks in white areas, the terminating of land ownership by blacks except in reserved areas, the illegalization of black res- idence on white farms (except as servants in the employ of whites), the control of</p>
<p>urban in  ux, and later, the denial of citizenship to Africans.50</p>
<p>Frantz Fanon describes the  spatialization of  colonial occupation in vivid terms. For him, colonial occupation entails   rst and foremost a division of space into compartments. It involves the setting of boundaries and internal frontiers epitomized by barracks and police stations; it is regulated by the language of pure force, immediate presence, and frequent and direct action; and it is premised on the principle of reciprocal exclusivity.51 But more important, it is the very way in which necropower operates: “The town belonging to the colonized people . . . is</p>

<p>a place of ill fame, peopled by men of evil repute. They are born there, it matters <strong>Necropolitics</strong> little where or how; they die there, it matters not where, nor how. It is a world</p>
<p>without spaciousness; men live there on top of each other. The native town is a</p>
<p>hungry town, starved of bread, of meat, of shoes, of coal, of light. The native</p>
<p>town is a crouching village, a town on its knees.”52 In this case, sovereignty means</p>
<p>the capacity to de  ne who matters and who does not, who is <em>disposable</em>and who</p>
<p>is not.</p>
<p>Late-modern colonial occupation differs in many ways from early-modern</p>
<p>occupation, particularly in its combining of the disciplinary, the biopolitical, and</p>
<p>the necropolitical. The most accomplished form of necropower is the contempo-</p>
<p>rary colonial occupation of Palestine.</p>
<p>Here, the colonial state derives its fundamental claim of sovereignty and legit-</p>
<p>imacy from the authority of its own particular narrative of history and identity.</p>
<p>This narrative is itself underpinned by the idea that the state has a divine right to</p>
<p>exist; the narrative competes with another for the same sacred space. Because the</p>
<p>two narratives are incompatible and the two populations are inextricably inter-</p>
<p>twined, any demarcation of the territory on the basis of pure identity is quasi-</p>
<p>impossible. Violence and sovereignty, in this case, claim a divine foundation:</p>
<p>peoplehood itself is forged by the worship of one deity, and national identity is</p>
<p>imagined as an identity against the Other, other deities.53 History, geography, car-</p>
<p>tography, and archaeology are supposed to back these claims, thereby closely</p>
<p>binding identity and topography. As a consequence, colonial violence and occu-</p>
<p>pation are profoundly underwritten by the sacred terror of truth and exclusivity</p>
<p>(mass expulsions, resettlement of “stateless” people in refugee camps, settlement</p>
<p>of new colonies). Lying beneath the terror of the sacred is the constant excava-</p>
<p>tion of missing bones; the permanent remembrance of a torn body hewn in a</p>
<p>thousand pieces and never self-same; the limits, or better, the impossibility of</p>
<p>representing for oneself an “original crime,” an unspeakable death: the terror of</p>
<p>the Holocaust.54</p>
<p>To return to Fanon’s spatial reading of colonial occupation, the late-modern</p>
<p>colonial occupation in Gaza and the West Bank presents three major characteris-</p>
<p>tics in relation to the working of the speci  c terror formation I have called</p>
<p>necropower. First is the dynamics of territorial fragmentation, the sealing off and</p>

<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> expansion of settlements. The objective of this process is twofold: to render any movement impossible and  to  implement separation along the  model  of  the</p>
<p>apartheid state. The occupied territories are therefore divided into a web of intri- cate internal borders and various isolated cells. According to Eyal Weizman, by departing from a planar division of a territory and embracing a principle of cre- ation of three-dimensional boundaries across sovereign bulks, this dispersal and segmentation clearly rede  nes the relationship between sovereignty and space.55 For Weizman, these actions constitute “the politics of verticality.” The resul- tant form of sovereignty might be called “vertical sovereignty.” Under a regime of vertical sovereignty, colonial occupation operates through schemes of over- and underpasses, a separation of the airspace from the ground. The ground itself is divided between its crust and the subterrain. Colonial occupation is also dictated by the very nature of the terrain and its topographical variations (hilltops and val- leys, mountains and bodies of water). Thus, high ground offers strategic assets not found in the valleys (effectiveness of sight, self-protection, panoptic forti  ca- tion that generates gazes to many different ends). Says Weizman: “Settlements could be seen as urban optical devices for surveillance and the exercise of power.” Under conditions of late-modern colonial occupation, surveillance is both inward- and outward-oriented, the eye acting as weapon and vice versa. Instead of the conclusive division between two nations across a boundary line, “the organiza- tion of the West Bank’s particular terrain has created multiple separations, provi- sional boundaries, which relate to each other through surveillance and control,” according to Weizman. Under these circumstances, colonial occupation is not only akin to control, surveillance, and separation, it is also tantamount to seclu- sion. It is a <em>splintering occupation</em>, along the lines of the splintering urbanism</p>
<p>characteristic of late modernity (suburban enclaves or gated communities).56 From an infrastructural point of view, a splintering form of colonial occupation</p>
<p>is characterized by a network of fast bypass roads, bridges, and tunnels that weave over and under one another in an attempt at maintaining the Fanonian “principle of reciprocal exclusivity.” According to Weizman, “the bypass roads attempt to separate Israeli traf  c networks from Palestinian ones, preferably without allowing them ever to cross. They therefore emphasize the overlapping of two separate geographies that inhabit the same landscape. At points where the networks do cross, a makeshift separation is created. Most often, small dust roads</p>

<p>Under conditions of vertical sovereignty and splintering colonial occupation,</p>
<p>communities are separated across a <em>y</em>-axis. This leads to a proliferation of the</p>
<p>sites of violence. The battlegrounds are not located solely at the surface of the</p>
<p>earth. The underground as well as the airspace are transformed into con  ict</p>
<p>zones. There is no continuity between the ground and the sky. Even the bound-</p>
<p>aries in airspace are divided between lower and upper layers. Everywhere, the</p>
<p>symbolics of the <em>top</em> (who is on top) is reiterated. Occupation of the skies there-</p>
<p>fore acquires a critical importance, since most of the policing is done from the air.</p>
<p>Various other technologies are mobilized to this effect: sensors aboard unmanned</p>
<p>air vehicles (UAVs), aerial reconnaissance jets, early warning Hawkeye planes,</p>
<p>assault helicopters, an Earth-observation satellite, techniques of “hologrammati-</p>
<p>zation.” Killing becomes precisely targeted.</p>
<p>Such precision is combined with the tactics of medieval siege warfare adapted</p>
<p>to the networked sprawl of urban refugee camps. An orchestrated and systematic</p>
<p>sabotage of the enemy’s societal and urban infrastructure network complements</p>
<p>the appropriation of land, water, and airspace resources. Critical to these tech-</p>
<p>niques of disabling the enemy is <em>bulldozing</em>: demolishing houses and cities; uproot-</p>

<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> combination of the three allocates to the colonial power an absolute domination</p>
<p>over the inhabitants of the occupied territory. The <em>state of siege</em> is itself a military institution. It allows a modality of killing that does not distinguish between the external and the internal enemy. Entire populations are the target of the sover- eign. The besieged villages and towns are sealed off and cut off from the world. Daily life is militarized. Freedom is given to local military commanders to use their discretion as to when and whom to shoot. Movement between the territorial cells requires formal permits. Local civil institutions are systematically destroyed. The besieged population is deprived of their means of income. Invisible killing is added to outright executions.</p>
<p><strong>War Machines and Heteronomy</strong></p>
<p>After having examined the workings of necropower under the conditions of late- modern colonial occupation, I would like to turn now to contemporary wars. Con- temporary wars belong to a new moment and can hardly be understood through earlier theories of “contractual violence” or typologies of “just” and “unjust” wars or even Carl von Clausewitz’s instrumentalism.60 According to Zygmunt Bauman, wars of the globalization era do not include the conquest, acquisition, and takeover of a territory among their objectives. Ideally, they are hit-and-run affairs. </p>
<p>The growing gap between high-tech and low-tech means of war has never been as evident as in the Gulf War and the Kosovo campaign. In both cases, the doctrine of “overwhelming or decisive force” was implemented to its full effect thanks to a military-technological revolution that has multiplied the capacity for destruction in unprecedented ways.61 Air war as it relates to altitude, ordnance, visibility, and intelligence is here a case in point. During the Gulf War, the combined use of smart bombs and bombs coated with depleted uranium (DU), high-tech stand-off weapons, electronic sensors, laser-guided missiles, cluster and asphyxiation bombs, stealth capabilities, unmanned aerial vehicles, and cyber- intelligence quickly crippled the enemy’s capabilities.</p>
<p>In Kosovo, the “degrading” of Serbian capabilities took the form of an infra- structural war that targeted and destroyed bridges, railroads, highways, commu-</p>

<p>nications networks, oil storage depots, heating plants, power stations, and water <strong>Necropolitics</strong> treatment facilities. As can be surmised, the execution of such a military strategy,</p>
<p>especially when combined with the imposition of sanctions, results in shutting</p>
<p>down the enemy’s life-support system. The enduring damage to civilian life is</p>
<p>particularly telling. For example, the destruction of the Pancevo petrochemical</p>
<p>complex in the outskirts of Belgrade during the Kosovo campaign “left the vicin-</p>
<p>ity so toxic with vinyl chloride, ammonia, mercury, naphtha and dioxin that preg-</p>
<p>nant women were directed to seek abortions, and all local women were advised to</p>
<p>avoid pregnancy for two years.”62</p>
<p>Wars of the globalization era therefore aim to force the enemy into submission</p>
<p>regardless of the immediate consequences, side effects, and “collateral damage” of</p>
<p>the military actions. In this sense, contemporary wars are more reminiscent of the</p>
<p>warfare strategy of the nomads than of the sedentary nations or the “conquer-and-</p>
<p>annex” territorial wars of modernity. In Bauman’s words: “They rest their superi-</p>
<p>ority over the settled population on the speed of their own movement; their own</p>
<p>ability to descend from nowhere without notice and vanish again without warning,</p>
<p>their ability to travel light and not to bother with the kind of belongings which con-</p>
<p><code></code>ne the mobility and the maneuvering potential of the sedentary people.”63</p>
<p>This new moment is one of global mobility. An important feature of the age of</p>
<p>global mobility is that military operations and the exercise of the right to kill are</p>
<p>no longer the sole monopoly of states, and the “regular army” is no longer the</p>
<p>unique modality of carrying out these functions. The claim to ultimate or   nal</p>
<p>authority in a particular political space is not easily made. Instead, a patchwork of</p>
<p>overlapping and incomplete rights to rule emerges, inextricably superimposed and</p>
<p>tangled, in which different de facto juridical instances are geographically interwo-</p>
<p>ven and plural allegiances, asymmetrical suzerainties, and enclaves abound.64 In</p>

<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> this heteronymous organization of territorial rights and claims, it makes little sense</p>
<p>to insist on distinctions between “internal” and “external” political realms, sepa- rated by clearly demarcated boundaries.</p>
<p>Let’s take Africa as an example. Here, the political economy of statehood dra- matically changed over the last quarter of the twentieth century. Many African states can no longer claim a monopoly on violence and on the means of coercion within their territory. Nor can they claim a monopoly on territorial boundaries. Coercion itself has become a market commodity. Military manpower is bought and sold on a market in which the identity of suppliers and purchasers means almost nothing. Urban militias, private armies, armies of regional lords, private security   rms, and state armies all claim the right to exercise violence or to kill. Neighboring states or rebel movements lease armies to poor states. Nonstate deployers of violence supply two critical coercive resources: labor and minerals. Increasingly, the vast majority of armies are composed of citizen soldiers, child soldiers, mercenaries, and privateers.65</p>
<p>Alongside armies have therefore emerged what, following Deleuze and Guat- tari, we could refer to as <em>war machines</em>.66 War machines are made up of segments of armed men that split up or merge with one another depending on the tasks to be carried out and the circumstances. Polymorphous and diffuse organizations, war machines are characterized by their capacity for metamorphosis. Their rela- tion to space is mobile. Sometimes, they enjoy complex links with state forms (from autonomy to incorporation). The state may, of its own doing, transform itself into a war machine. It may moreover appropriate to itself an existing war machine or help to create one. War machines function by borrowing from regu- lar armies while incorporating new elements well adapted to the principle of seg- mentation and deterritorialization. Regular armies, in turn, may readily appropri- ate some of the characteristics of war machines.</p>
<p>A war machine combines a plurality of functions. It has the features of a polit- ical organization and a mercantile company. It operates through capture and depredations and can even coin its own money. In order to fuel the extraction and</p>

<p>export of natural resources located in the territory they control, war machines <strong>Necropolitics</strong> forge direct connections with transnational networks. War machines emerged in</p>
<p>Africa during the last quarter of the twentieth century in direct relation to the ero-</p>
<p>sion of the postcolonial state’s capacity to build the economic underpinnings of</p>
<p>political authority and order. This capacity involves raising revenue and com-</p>
<p>manding and regulating access to natural resources within a well-de  ned terri-</p>
<p>tory. In the mid-1970s, as the state’s ability to maintain this capacity began to</p>
<p>erode, there emerged a clear-cut link between monetary instability and spatial</p>
<p>fragmentation. In the 1980s, the brutal experience of money suddenly losing its</p>
<p>value became more commonplace, with various countries undergoing cycles of</p>
<p>hyperin  ation (which included such stunts as the sudden replacement of a cur-</p>
<p>rency). During the last decades of the twentieth century, monetary circulation has</p>
<p>in  uenced state and society in at least two different ways.</p>
<p>First, we have seen a general drying-up of liquidities and their gradual con-</p>
<p>centration along certain channels, access to which has been subject to increas-</p>
<p>ingly draconian conditions. As a result, the number of individuals endowed with</p>
<p>the material means to control dependents through the creation of  debts has</p>
<p>abruptly decreased. Historically, capturing and   xing dependents through the</p>
<p>mechanism of debt has always been a central aspect of both the production of</p>
<p>people and the constitution of the political bond.67 Such bonds were crucial in</p>
<p>determining the value of persons and gauging their value and utility. When their</p>
<p>value and utility were not proven, they could be disposed of as slaves, pawns, or</p>
<p>clients.</p>
<p>Second, the controlled in  ow and the   xing of movements of money around</p>
<p>zones in which speci  c resources are extracted has made possible the formation</p>
<p>of <em>enclave economies</em>and has shifted the old calculus between people and things.</p>
<p>The concentration of activities connected with the extraction of valuable resources</p>
<p>around these enclaves has, in return, turned the enclaves into privileged spaces of</p>
<p>war and death. War itself is fed by increased sales of the products extracted.68</p>
<p>New linkages have therefore emerged between war making, war machines, and</p>
<p>resource extraction.69 War machines are implicated in the constitution of highly</p>

<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> transnational local or regional economies. In most places, the collapse of formal</p>
<p>political institutions under the strain of violence tends to lead to the formation of militia economies. War machines (in this case militias or rebel movements) rapidly become highly organized mechanisms of predation, taxing the territories and the population they occupy and drawing on a range of transnational networks and diasporas that provide both material and   nancial support.</p>
<p>Correlated to the new geography of resource extraction is the emergence of an unprecedented form of governmentality that consists in the <em>management of the multitudes.</em>The extraction and looting of natural resources by war machines goes hand in hand with brutal attempts to immobilize and spatially   x whole cate- gories of people or, paradoxically, to unleash them, to force them to scatter over broad areas no longer contained by the boundaries of a territorial state. As a polit- ical category, populations are then disaggregated into rebels, child soldiers, vic- tims or refugees, or civilians incapacitated by mutilation or simply massacred on the model of ancient sacri  ces, while the “survivors,” after a horri  c exodus, are con  ned in camps and zones of exception.70</p>
<p>This form of governmentality is different from the colonial <em>commandement</em>.<sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-2' name='ref-footnote-2'>2</a></sup> The techniques of policing and discipline and the choice between obedience and simulation that characterized the colonial and postcolonial potentate are gradu- ally being replaced by an alternative that is more tragic because more extreme. Technologies of destruction have become more tactile, more anatomical and sen- sorial, in a context in which the choice is between life and death.72 If power still depends on tight control over bodies (or on concentrating them in camps), the new technologies of destruction are less concerned with inscribing bodies within disciplinary apparatuses as inscribing them, when the time comes, within the order of the maximal economy now represented by the “massacre.” In turn, the generalization of insecurity has deepened the societal distinction between those who bear weapons and those who do not (<em>loi de repartition des armes</em>).

<p>ingly, war is no longer waged between armies of two sovereign states. It is waged <strong>Necropolitics</strong> by armed groups acting behind the mask of the state against armed groups that</p>
<p>have no state but control very distinct territories; both sides having as their main</p>

<p>where armed dissidents have not completely taken over state power, they have</p>

<p>they administer on the model of   efdoms, especially where there are mineral</p>
<p>deposits.73</p>
<p>The ways of killing do not themselves vary much. In the case of massacres in</p>
<p>particular, lifeless bodies are quickly reduced to the status of simple skeletons.</p>
<p>Their morphology henceforth inscribes them in the register of undifferentiated</p>
<p>generality: simple relics of an unburied pain, empty, meaningless corporealities,</p>
<p>strange deposits plunged into cruel stupor. In the case of the Rwandan geno-</p>
<p>cide—in which a number of skeletons were at least preserved in a visible state,</p>
<p>if not exhumed—what is striking is the tension between the petri  cation of the</p>
<p>bones and their strange coolness on one hand, and on the other, their stubborn</p>
<p>will to mean, to signify something.</p>
<p>In these impassive bits of bone, there seems to be no <em>ataraxia</em>: nothing but the</p>
<p>illusory rejection of a death that has already occurred. In other cases, in which</p>
<p>physical amputation replaces immediate death, cutting off limbs opens the way to</p>
<p>the deployment of techniques of incision, ablation, and excision that also have</p>
<p>bones as their target. The traces of this demiurgic surgery persist for a long time,</p>

<p>Let us return to the example of Palestine where two apparently irreconcilable logics are confronting each other: the <em>logic of martyrdom</em> and the <em>logic of sur- vival</em>.

<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> death on the other. Terror and death are at the heart of each. As Elias Canetti</p>
<p>reminds us, the survivor is the one who, having stood in the path of death, know- ing of many deaths and standing in the midst of the fallen, is still alive. Or, more precisely, the survivor is the one who has taken on a whole pack of enemies and managed not only to escape alive, but to kill his or her attackers. This is why, to a large extent, the lowest form of survival is killing. Canetti points out that in the logic of survival, “each man is the enemy of every other.” Even more radically, in the logic of survival one’s horror at the sight of death turns into satisfaction that it is someone else who is dead. It is the death of the other, his or her physical pres- ence as a corpse, that makes the survivor feel unique. And each enemy killed makes the survivor feel more secure.74</p>
<p>The logic of martyrdom proceeds along different lines. It is epitomized by the   gure of the “suicide bomber,” which itself raises a number of questions. What intrinsic difference is there between killing with a missile helicopter or a tank and killing with one’s own body? Does the distinction between the arms used to in  ict death prevent the establishment of a system of general exchange between the manner of killing and the manner of dying?</p>
<p>The “suicide bomber” wears no ordinary soldier’s uniform and displays no weapon. The candidate for martyrdom chases his or her targets; the enemy is a prey for whom a trap is set. Signi  cant in this respect is the location of the ambush laid: the bus stop, the café, the discotheque, the marketplace, the checkpoint, the road—in sum, the spaces of everyday life.</p>
<p>The trapping of the body is added to the ambush location. The candidate for martyrdom transforms his or her body into a mask that hides the soon-to-be- detonated weapon. Unlike the tank or the missile that is clearly visible, the weapon carried in the shape of the body is invisible. Thus concealed, it forms part of the body. It is so intimately part of the body that at the time of detonation it annihilates the body of its bearer, who carries with it the bodies of others when it does not reduce them to pieces. The body does not simply conceal a weapon. The body is transformed into a weapon, not in a metaphorical sense but in the truly ballistic sense.</p>
<p>In this instance, my death goes hand in hand with the death of the Other. Homicide and suicide are accomplished in the same act. And to a large extent, resistance and self-destruction are synonymous. To deal out death is therefore to reduce the other and oneself to the status of pieces of inert   esh, scattered every-</p>

<p>where, and assembled with dif  culty before the burial. In this case, war is the war <strong>Necropolitics</strong> of body on body (<em>guerre au corps-à-corps</em>). To kill, one has to come as close as</p>
<p>possible to the body of the enemy. To detonate the bomb necessitates resolving</p>
<p>the question of distance, through the work of proximity and concealment.</p>
<p>How are we to interpret this manner of spilling blood in which death is not</p>
<p>simply that which is <em>my own</em>, but always goes hand in hand with the death of the</p>
<p>other?75 How does it differ from death in  icted by a tank or a missile, in a context</p>
<p>in which the cost of my survival is calculated in terms of my capacity and readi-</p>
<p>ness to kill someone else? In the logic of “martyrdom,” the will to die is fused</p>
<p>with the willingness to take the enemy with you, that is, with closing the door on</p>
<p>the possibility of life for everyone. This logic seems contrary to another one,</p>
<p>which consists in wishing to impose death on others while preserving one’s own</p>
<p>life. Canetti describes this moment of survival as a moment of power. In such a</p>
<p>case,  triumph  develops  precisely  from  the  possibility of  being  there  when </p>
<p>the others (in this case the enemy) are no longer there. Such is the logic of hero-</p>
<p>ism as classically understood: to execute others while holding one’s own death at</p>
<p>a distance.</p>
<p>In the logic of martyrdom, a new semiosis of killing emerges. It is not neces-</p>
<p>sarily based on a relationship between form and matter. As I have already indi-</p>
<p>cated, the body here becomes the very uniform of the martyr. But the body as</p>
<p>such is not only an object to protect against danger and death. The body in itself</p>
<p>has neither power nor value. The power and value of the body result from a</p>
<p>process of abstraction based on the desire for eternity. In that sense, the martyr,</p>
<p>having established a moment of supremacy in which the subject overcomes his</p>
<p>own mortality, can be seen as laboring under the sign of the future. In other</p>
<p>words, in death the future is collapsed into the present.</p>
<p>In its desire for eternity, the besieged body passes through two stages. First, it</p>
<p>is transformed into a mere thing, malleable matter. Second, the manner in which</p>
<p>it is put to death—suicide—affords it its ultimate signi  cation. The matter of the</p>
<p>body, or again the matter which is the body, is invested with properties that can-</p>
<p>not be deduced from its character as a thing, but from a transcendental <em>nomos</em>out-</p>
<p>side it. The besieged body becomes a piece of metal whose function is, through</p>
<p>sacri  ce, to bring eternal life into being. The body duplicates itself and, in death,</p>
<p>literally and metaphorically escapes the state of siege and occupation.</p>
<p>Let me explore, in conclusion, the relation between terror, freedom, and sac-</p>
<p>ri  ce. Martin Heidegger argues that the human’s “being toward death” is the deci-</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> sive condition of all true human freedom.76 In other words, one is free to live</p>
<p>one’s own life only because one is free to die one’s own death. Whereas Heideg- ger grants an existential status to being-toward-death and considers it an event of freedom, Bataille suggests that “sacri  ce in reality reveals nothing.” It is not sim- ply the absolute manifestation of negativity. It is also a comedy. For Bataille, death reveals the human subject’s animal side, which he refers to moreover as the subject’s “natural being.” “For man to reveal himself in the end, he has to die, but he will have to do so while alive—by looking at himself ceasing to exist,” he adds. In other words, the human subject has to be fully alive at the very moment of dying, to be aware of his or her death, to live with the impression of actually dying. Death itself must become awareness of the self at the very time that it does away with the conscious being. “In a sense, this is what happens (what at least is on the point of taking place, or what takes place in an elusive, fugitive manner), by means of a subterfuge in the sacri  ce. In the sacri  ce, the sacri  ced identi  es himself with the animal on the point of death. Thus he dies seeing himself die, and even, in some sense, through his own will, at one with the weapon of sacri-   ce. But this is play!” And for Bataille, play is more or less the means by which the human subject “voluntarily tricks himself.”77</p>
<p>How does the notion of play and trickery relate to the “suicide bomber”? There is no doubt that in the case of the suicide bomber the sacri  ce consists of the spectacular putting to death of the self, of becoming his or her own victim (self-sacri  ce). The self-sacri  ced proceeds to take power over his or her death and to approach it head-on. This power may be derived from the belief that the destruction of one’s own body does not affect the continuity of the being. The idea is that the being exists outside us. The self-sacri  ce consists, here, in the removal of a twofold prohibition: that of self-immolation (suicide) and that of murder. Unlike primitive sacri  ces, however, there is no animal to serve as a substitute victim. Death here achieves the character of a transgression. But unlike cruci  x- ion, it has no expiatory dimension. It is not related to the Hegelian paradigms of prestige or recognition. Indeed, a dead person cannot recognize his or her killer, who is also dead. Does this imply that death occurs here as pure annihilation and nothingness, excess and scandal?</p>
<p>Whether read from the perspective of slavery or of colonial occupation, death and freedom are irrevocably interwoven. As we have seen, terror is a de  ning feature of both slave and late-modern colonial regimes. Both regimes are also</p>

<p>dren, con  scating papers, or dumping garbage in the middle of a residential neigh-</p>
<p>borhood; border guards kicking over a vegetable stand or closing borders at whim;</p>
<p>bones broken; shootings and fatalities—a certain kind of madness.78</p>
<p>In such circumstances, the discipline of life and the necessities of hardship</p>
<p>(trial by death) are marked by excess. What connects terror, death, and freedom</p>
<p>is an <em>ecstatic</em> notion of temporality and politics. The future, here, can be authen-</p>
<p>tically anticipated, but not in the present. The present itself is but a moment of</p>
<p>vision—vision of the freedom not yet come. Death in the present is the mediator</p>
<p>of redemption. Far from being an encounter with a limit, boundary, or barrier, it is</p>
<p>experienced as “a release from terror and bondage.”79 As Gilroy notes, this pref-</p>
<p>erence for death over continued servitude is a commentary on the nature of free-</p>
<p>dom itself (or the lack thereof). If this lack is the very nature of what it means for</p>
<p>the slave or the colonized to exist, the same lack is also precisely the way in</p>
<p>which he or she takes account of his or her mortality. Referring to the practice of</p>
<p>individual or mass suicide by slaves cornered by the slave catchers, Gilroy sug-</p>
<p>gests that death, in this case, can be represented as agency. For death is precisely</p>
<p>that from and over which I have power. But it is also that space where freedom</p>
<p>and negation operate. <strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In this essay I have argued that contemporary forms of subjugation of life to the power of death (necropolitics) profoundly recon  gure the relations among resis- tance, sacri  ce, and terror. I have demonstrated that the notion of biopower is insuf  cient to account for contemporary forms of subjugation of life to the power</p>

<p><strong>Public Culture</strong> of death. Moreover I have put forward the notion of necropolitics and necro-</p>
<p>power to account for the various ways in which, in our contemporary world, weapons are deployed in the interest of maximum destruction of persons and the creation of <em>death-worlds</em>, new and unique forms of social existence in which vast populations are subjected to conditions of life conferring upon them the status of <em>living dead</em>. The essay has also outlined some of the repressed topographies of cruelty (the plantation and the colony in particular) and has suggested that under conditions of necropower, the lines between resistance and suicide, sacri  ce and redemption, martyrdom and freedom are blurred.</p>

<li><p>In <em>The Racial State</em> (Malden, Mass: Blackwell, 2002), David Theo Goldberg argues that from</p>
<p>the nineteenth century on, there are at least two historically competing traditions of racial rational- ization: naturism (based on an inferiority claim) and historicism (based on the claim of the historical “immaturity”—and therefore “educability”—of the natives). In a private communication (23 August 2002), he argues that these two traditions played out differently when it came to issues of sovereignty, states of exception, and forms of necropower. In his view, necropower can take multiple forms: the terror of actual death; or a more “benevolent” form—the result of which is the destruction of a cul- ture in order to “save the people” from themselves.</p>
