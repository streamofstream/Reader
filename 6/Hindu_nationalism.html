<p>This is a story from our past, from a time so remote that we argue, sometimes, about whether we should call it history or mythology. Some of us call it a fairy tale. But on this we agree: that to tell a story about the past is to tell a story about the present.... This is the question we ask ourselves as we explore and narrate our history: how did we get here from there? </p>

As children, we lived our days and nights enraptured by stories from parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and neighbors. For my generation, once literate, the wildly popular world of the comic book series <em>Amar Chitra Katha</em> consumed us.1 Unbeknownst to our young minds, the series brought themes of Hindu nationalism and conservative cultural politics of gender and caste into a series of now classic characters drawn from mythology (McLain 2009, 2011; Sreenivas </p>

<p>2010).2 The powerful stories with their vibrant graphics reverberate and endure. Little did we realize that these legendary stories linked masculin - ity, Hinduism, (fair) skin color, and (upper) caste with ideals of the good </p>
<p>and desirable—authority, excellence, and virtue (Amin 2017). These sto - ries successfully circulated Indian mythological imaginations to many </p>
<p>mul tireligious and secular childhoods.3 For many of us who grew up going to Catholic and Christian schools, multiple religious stories flowed seam - lessly. The stories, largely from the Hindu mythologies of the <em>Ramayana</em> </p>
<p>and the <em>Mahabharata</em>, held a cornucopia of modes of storytelling—stories within stories within stories. They helped us discover astonishing new worlds peopled by fabulous characters entangled in the mundane and the fantastical. These stories were rich in intrigue and drama and prom ised endless possibilities. The characters spanned biologies—animals, plants, humans, human-animal hybrids, imaginary creatures, and fantastical beasts. Monkeys flew across the skies. Humans transmuted, appearing with elephant or lion heads or effortlessly transforming into animal forms. Worlds of humans, gods, and demons coexisted, and individuals moved between these worlds through acts and deeds. The West may have virgin birth, but India has promiscuous possibilities!</p>
<p>The ethos of enchantment and the magical was reinforced with tales of Christian saints, Muslim pirs, local swamis and gurus, spirit figures, jinns, and sacred healing shrines. The promise of good health and wealth always sent people in pilgrimage to temples, mosques, churches, syna - gogues, and various animist shrines. Tales of human miracles were extolled in stories about saints like Shirdi Sai Baba, Satya Sai Baba, Syed Shah Karee mullah Hussaini Qadri, Kat Bava, Marttaśmūni, Katamattattachan,  Sister Alphonsa, and Mother Teresa, among others. </p>
<p>Stories were always multiple, and locally inflected. If I sound too romantic about my childhood, let me temper it. As I elaborate in the Notes to the Mythopoeia at the end of the book, these tales were neither inno - cent nor apolitical. The stories resolutely secured social hierarchies. And people resisted. Dark-skinned demon gods from North India were trans - formed by Southern Indians into erudite and revered gods. The patriarchal versions of the <em>Ramayana</em> have spawned queer <em>Ramayanas</em> and feminist <em>Sitayanas</em>. Local animist traditions circulated stories of regional and local </p>
<p>spirits, gods and goddesses not represented in the repertoire of upper- caste mythologies. As these stories traveled across and outside India, new variations emerged. The natural, preternatural, and supernatural cohered, as spectral and ethereal worlds mingled with the mythological and histori - cal stories in school textbooks, into a sumptuous blend of this world and others. Worlds commingled—historical figures alongside phantasms and ghosts, gods and devils, demons and angels, and haunting ethereal, incor - poreal beings. Stories eschewed the hubris of time, form, corporeality, modernity, science, religion, or rationality. These were the delicious and lavish imaginations of an Indian upbringing. As Vikram Chandra (2014: 42) explains:</p>
<p>This multiply layered narrative was how I lived within myself, how  I knew myself, how I spoke to myself. There was the modern me, and also certain other simultaneous selves who lived on alongside. These “shadow selves”... responded passionately and instantly to epic tropes, whether in the <em>Mahabharata</em> or in Hindi films; believed implicitly and stubbornly in reincarnation despite a devotion to Enlightenment positivism; insisted on regarding matter and con - sciousness as one; and experienced the world and oneself as the </p>
<p><code></code>habitations of <em>devatas</em>, “deities” who simultaneously represent inner realities and cosmic principles.</p>
<p>LorD ganesha’s PLastic surgeon: </p>
<p>the BioPoLitics oF hinDu nationaLism</p>
<p>The exuberant mythological stories of India have commingled with notions of modernity and orthodoxy, the sacred and the profane, of the centuries-long evolution of science and religion, mutating, shifting, and transforming through the local and the global, and the histories of colo - nialism, independence, postcolonialism, globalization, and nationalisms. Imagine my surprise when these worlds came hurtling into focus one day.</p>
<p>On October 25, 2014, India’s new prime minister, Narendra Modi, while inaugurating a new hospital run by the industrial group Reliance in Mumbai, proclaimed (Rahman 2014):</p>
<p>We can feel proud of what our country has achieved in medical </p>
<p><code></code>science at one point of time.... We all read about Karna in the Mahabharata. If we think a little more, we realize that the Maha - bharata says Karna was not born from his mother’s womb. This </p>
<p>means that genetic science was present at that time. That is why Karna could be born outside his mother’s womb.</p>
<p>We worship Lord Ganesha. There must have been some plastic surgeon at that time who got an elephant’s head on the body of a human being and began the practice of plastic surgery.</p>
<p>Here the narratives of Indian mythology mingle with the powers of sci - entific reason to imbue the fantasies of Indian mythology and storyt elling with rational possibilities and an energetic Indian scientific prehistory. Perhaps Modi was being humorous or ironic (as some of his supporters have claimed to me). But Ganesha is an elephant-headed god; he is divine. Modi could well have claimed that a god could, through divine powers, connect the bodies of an elephant and human, or that a god does not need circulating blood or a central nervous system! Rather, Modi invented a plastic surgeon to perform an operation to connect the two interspecies body parts. This is precisely the imagination of Hindu nationalism that I find fascinating and significant—science and technology and their practi - tioners mediate mythological and divine worlds. Even gods need doctors! What we witnessed was the prime minister of India, recently elected by a robust majority in the world’s largest democracy, making bold claims of the scientific basis of an ancient Vedic civilization4. </p>
<p>Modi was not the first. These claims that modern technology, includ - ing surrogacy, plastic surgery, genomics, evolution, atomic physics, air travel, chemistry, architecture, fluid dynamics, geology, botany, and zool - ogy, had its roots in the ancient Puranas5 and the Vedas have been repeated by members of the Hindu right, including various party members and government officials in power (I. Patel 1984; Nanda 2016). We have also seen attempts to link contemporary scientific knowledge with Indian mythology (Ganeshaiah, Vasudeva, and Shaanker 2009; Naresh, Mukesh, and Vivek 2013; Kalra, Baruah, and Kalra 2016; Padhy 2013). Merely writing </p>
<p>off Modi’s revision of history, his version of Hinduism, or his interpreta - tion and manipulation of science as “silliness” misses the significance and </p>
<p>power of the brand of political Hinduism for which Modi stands. At the heart of this contemporary form of Hindu nationalism, <em>Hindutva</em> or “Hind - uness,” is the imagination of a great and grand Hindu past where science, technology, and philosophy thrived. Unlike other fundamentalisms, Hindu nationalism brings together a melding of science and religion, the ancient and the modern, the past and the present into a powerful brand </p>
<p>of nationalism, a vision of India as an “archaic modernity” (Subramaniam 2000). Science and religion have long been potent forces within Indian politics and culture, but in recent times they have been mobilized together </p>
<p>for a political Hindu nationalist vision. Hindu dominance, intolerance of, and supremacy over other religions, faiths, and traditions, and hatred and </p>
<p>bigotry toward non-Hindus, mark the religious nationalist vision. Rather than characterize Hinduism as ancient, nonmodern, or traditional, the </p>
<p>Hindu nationalists have embraced capitalism, Western science, and tech - nology as elements of a modern, Hindu nation.6</p>
<p>As an apt slogan on a wall once proclaimed, “Be Modern, Not West - ern.”7 Indeed, India claims its own modernity, and the much-touted Vedic sciences, math, and technologies undergird claims of a great ancient civili - zation and its own enlightenment. Yet alongside this vision of a scientific and technological superpower, Hindu nationalists espouse a conservative worldview on gender and caste. The recasting and reframing of women as “authentic,” as symbols of the nation, signal the superiority of the East, recruiting women into nation building (Sangari and Vaid 1989). Indeed, during a world tour, Prime Minister Modi proudly declared India to be “the only country in the world where god was conceptualized in the female form” (Baruah 2014). Behind this symbolic female power lie a renewed Hindu masculinity and a redomestication of women. Science and religion have proved to be two powerful tools through which religious nationalists have imagined and engaged with this project of masculinization.</p>
<p>With the world listening, Modi, during his first speech as prime min - ister to the United Nations, proposed that we create an International Yoga Day, since it “could help people connect better with the planet” and could “help us deal with climate change” (<em>BBC News</em> 2014). This bold claim of the healing powers of ancient Yoga is similar to his embrace of <em>Star Wars</em> in another speech, this time in Madison Square Garden, in which he told his jubilant diasporic Indian audience, “May the force be with you!” (Ridley </p>
<p>2014). Such unabashed proclamations have grown in tandem with a rise of Hindu nationalism as a thoroughly modern, ambitious, global, and organized political power (Hansen 1999). Modi’s declaration about ancient India is not mere silliness but reveals a deep-seated belief in the lost greatness of an ancient India, a greatness that the movement means to reclaim. Science and religion here are not oppositional forces but syn- cretic collaborators. </p>
<p>Behind the euphoric narrative of India as an emerging world power lies a fascinating but untold story of an evolving relationship between science and religion. As India emerges as a global power, the story of science and religion is important because it is precisely here that India’s cont estations with modernity emerge. To date, there has been little explor ation of the rela tionships among gender, religion, and science. India’s narrative of national development and scientific and technological prowess as well as its claims to an ancient scientific and cultural civilization are all key to the country’s national identity as an emerging global superpower. This book fills this gap by exploring the enduring relationship of science and religion in India as both forged practices and ideologies that resist gender and caste transformations. </p>
<p>We are witnessing in India, like in many parts of the world, a hyper - nationalism: nationalistic fervor on multiple fronts. Through five illus tra- tive cases involving biological claims, I explore an emerging bionationalism. The cases are varied, spanning stories of a revival of an ancient Hindu science of architecture, the politics of “unnatural” sex as enshrined in Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (which the Indian Supreme Court recently ruled on), the veracity of claims of a flying monkey god Hanu - man and a bridge he built, debates on the peopling of India through new genomic evidence, the revival of traditional systems of Indian medicine through genomics and pharmaceuticals, the growth and subsequent ban of gestational surrogacy, and the rise of old Vedic gestational sciences. I am fiercely critical of the current configuration of political Hinduism that domi - nates India, but rather than reject India or Hinduism, I want to embrace them in their more progressive and imaginative possibilities.</p>
<p>It is a blessing to be writing in the twenty-first century, when so much excellent scholarship has already complicated any notion of neat binaries, facile nativisms, innocent nationalisms, or simplistic civilization logics </p>
<p>and offered in its place a world teeming with complex global circulations of power, knowledges, resources, and peoples. The field of feminist studies has impressed upon me that there is no sex, gender, or sexuality that is not co-constituted with race, class, caste, and nation. The field of religious studies has taught me that religions and the religious have porous bound - aries, bleeding into everyday life, culture, history, and politics. The field of science and technology studies (STS) reminds me that science and scientific knowledge are co-constructed with the social and embedded in its historical and political contexts. Histories of colonialism, casteism, slavery, and patriarchy shape them all. These rich traditions of analyses inform, shape, and animate this book.</p>
<p>In exploring the contours of modernity in India and the confluence of science and religion, one must understand India as a site of a scientized religion and a religionized science (Subramaniam 2000). Hindu national - ists celebrate both the Vedic sciences and the scientific Vedas. Any inter - disciplinary exploration necessitates introducing fields to one another. I have crafted this introduction very deliberately into seven sections so each reader can choose relevant parts. Section 1, “Bionationalism,” begins with a discussion of why the biological, particularly the biopolitical, proves to be a useful lens for India; it allows us to understand how old, and often conservative, cultural categories of gender, caste, and sexuality are trans - formed anew in modern scientific discourse. Section 2, “Archaic Moder - nities,” develops the concept of archaic modernities and its gendered dimensions. Biological science, rather than a universal enterprise, morphs into locally modulated sciences. In section 3, “India’s Modern Temples,” I draw from the history of science and STS to argue for a longer history of the imbrications of science and religion. Science in India has been shaped by its long-enduring relationship with Indian religious practices and cul - tures. In section 4, “Secularism’s Religion,” I explain the multiple valences of the term <em>religion</em> and define it at its most capacious. I explore the par - ticular relationship of religion and secularism, and how religion spills over into the social, political, and cultural. Section 5, “Lost in Translation,” traces the difficulties of writing about the “West and the rest.” A Euro - centric focus plagues all academic fields, rendering the rest of the world as “special cases.” In this section, I explore why we must, and how we might, decenter the “West” to develop more robust theoretical engagements with </p>
<p>the world. I follow with section 6, “Bionarratives,” a methodological section exploring the challenges of writing about religion, science, and postcolonialism. I offer bionarratives and helical (spiraling) thigmotropic storytelling as innovations that help us better capture the global travels of science. I end with section 7, “Avatars for Stolen Dreams,” a theory of avatars as a conceptual tool for postcolonial biopolitics. </p>
<p>Throughout the book, my aim is to make a sustained and impas - sioned case for the importance of feminist postcolonial STS, so that the ideas are not relegated to the margins as “just” a particular analytic for India, or “just” for postcolonial nations, but as a central analytic project for all feminism(s), science(s), and STS. In my view, we simply cannot afford not to.</p>

<li>BionationaLism: the BioPoLitics oF hinDu nationaLism</li>

</ol>
<p>One of the hallmarks of Hindu nationalism is the centrality of “biology” and the scientific within the imagination, teachings, and practices of a political Hindu nationalism—claims of common blood, indigenous DNA, unique theories, native ecologies, and regimes of bodily discipline are all grounded in a vision of Hinduism as a modern, scientific religion. It is thus a thoroughly scientific nationalism. Since I focus on the biological sciences, I have adopted the word <em>bionationalism</em>. First conceived by Gott - weis and Kim (2009) in the context of World War II South Korea, <em>bio- na tionalism</em> captures the transformation of traditional ethnic nationalism, primarily of blood and group affiliation, into a biopolitical construct grounded in the biological and scientific. I borrow their term to elaborate a bionationalism in the Indian context, where Hindu nationalist ideas and ideologies are scientized through biopolitical claims about gender, race, caste, and sexuality. Essentialist claims of caste continue to be bolstered in a country where caste remains a defining factor. Indeed, no aspect of life in India is untouched by caste—religious, social, economic, and political.</p>
<p>In attempting to trace the imbricated histories of science and Hindu - ism, I focus on the biological sciences for several reasons. First, Hindu nationalists unequivocally claim the sciences as part of Hinduism and its knowledge system. Biology is central to the imaginations of this </p>
<p>thoroughly scientific nationalism. Second, the “biological”—the body and the workings of the body—is central to the philosophies and daily prac - tices of Hindu nationalism. The idea of a militaristic and armed mas - culinity is deeply rooted in patriarchal conceptions of Hinduism and a biopolitical conception of the body (McDonald 1999). Indeed, bodily dis - cipline through a daily exercise regime, meditation, and yoga is extolled because strong minds need virile bodies. These practices form the corner - stone of training young cadres of Hindu nationalist grassroots organiza - tions such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in neighborhood <em>shakha</em>s and schools all across India. Physical discipline is seen as an essen - tial element for overall discipline; a strong body produces a pure mind (Chitkara 2004). However, women can embody such nationalist honor </p>
<p>only if they remain chaste and virtuous, never challenging patriarchal Hindu family values (S. Banerjee 2006). Third, biological metaphors and concepts litter the landscapes of the Hindu “body politic”—from meta - phors of “pure” Hindu blood, blood ties, tissues, and DNA to metaphors </p>
<p>of biological geographies, landscapes, and ecologies. The alleged hyper - fertility of minority women, especially Muslim women, continues to haunt </p>
<p>Hindu nationalist anxieties. The liveliness of biology is important to the vitality of politics and social movements. Fourth, the biological transcends </p>
<p>Hindu nationalism. Deeply imbricated in religion and science, the biologi - cal sciences are central to conceptions of the body, of health and illness. </p>
<p>In India, and its cultural imaginations, the boundaries between body and spirit, human and nonhuman, living and nonliving, and natural, preter - natural, and supernatural have long been incredibly porous. Global univer - sal histories miss the particularities of local contexts and transformations </p>
<p>as well as the local and daily practices and pro cesses (Phalkey 2013). </p>
<p>Fifth, tracing biological knowledge allows us to see the converse—how local biological knowledge and categories are deeply connected to global preoccupations. Biological claims of gender, race, caste, and sexuality have been a mainstay of scientific knowledge (W. Anderson 2002a; Philip 2004). We can trace how science’s oppressive histories (for example of race and caste) find new reinstantiations. Old stories are retold in new scientific language, the new narratives quickly adapting to shifting power structures in India. Striking is its recursive nature—certain political con - cerns return to haunt us repeatedly. Finally, recent innovations in the </p>
<p>history of science propel us to move from seeing science as purely an ideological tool of empire or the state (Nandy 1988; Baber 1996) to seeing </p>
<p>it as a set of model knowledge systems that emerge from particu  lar historical, economic, and political contexts (Ganeri 2013). Focusing on biological knowledge in India allows us to trace local practices and dem - onstrate how religion and science can come to be deeply and inextricably interconnected. </p>
<p>I draw on Foucault’s notion of biopolitics, recognizing that it emerges from a Western colonialist genealogy, and that biopolitics in the colonial and postcolonial worlds need to be understood differently (Legg 2007; Stoler 2002). While Foucault introduced the terms <em>biopolitics</em> and  <em>bio- power</em>, he did not fully describe or explain them in his works and often used them in conflicting and even contradictory ways. But the concept captures something important, as evidenced by the “intensity of the debate and the prominence of biopolitics” (Lemke 2011), and it remains a useful concept to think and work with, even in contexts for which it was not developed. In a singular focus on tracing the circuits of power in the West, Foucault theorizes a significant shift in power in the eighteenth century from “sovereign power” into state “biopower.” He argues that societies witnessed a transformation from the old “right to <em>take life</em> or <em>let live</em>” to a new “power to <em>make live</em> and <em>let die</em>” (emphasis mine). In short, Foucault ([1976] 1998: 137) described biopolitics as life, and its governing imperative “as a form of power that exerts a positive influence on life, that endeavors to administer, optimize, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive regulations.” Biopower is not top- down and imposed by a sovereign power but diffuse and embodied in dis - course, knowledge, and “regimes of truth.” As Foucault shows, biopolitics transformed the effects of power from a negative (something that excludes, represses, masks, and conceals) to a positive (something that prod  uces). By the nineteenth century, biopower’s dual focus on the “anatomo-politics of the human body” and “regulatory controls” of population came together through a series of “great technologies of power.” We witnessed new kinds of political struggle “in which ‘life as a political object’ was turned back against the controls exercised over it, in the name of claims to a ‘right’ to life, to one’s body, to health, to the satisfaction of one’s needs” (Rabinow and Rose 2006: 196). Rather than be forced or coerced into controlling </p>
<p>and managing our biologies, we voluntarily submit to regimes of con - trol. For example, eugenic logics today are not always enacted through “forced sterilization” but often in regimes under which individuals are said to “volunteer” to terminate pregnancies out of free will and “choice” (D. Roberts 2009).</p>
<p>India reminds us that the history of biopolitics is uneven, and biopoli - tics in India needs to be understood in a different register from the West, more as a layered history of the precolonial, colonial, and postcolonial. It is in part shaped by Western practices of governmentality, institutional - ized through the British Empire during colonial rule but also through biopolitical practices deeply embedded in local practices and religions. While this book largely focuses on bionationalism in recent years and its striking characteristics with the rise of Hindu nationalism, as you will see, bionationalism has a longer history through earlier religious nationalist and secular governments. In particular, politics of gender, class, caste, sexu - ality, and nation have long shaped the biopolitical contours of India, albeit unevenly and heterogeneously. Although varied geographically, strict laws of purity and pollution, regimes of body care, and codes of endogamy have long governed South Asia. British colonial rule brought with it the prac - tices of Western governmentality and its biopolitical dimensions that came to confront local biopolitical practices in the subcontinent.8 In this sense, we can understand colonial rule and the resistance to colonialism as a clash of competing biopolitical claims (Prakash 1999). There was no easy alliance, and anticolonial struggles and the independence movement at times contested and at times colluded with the British, helping shape a new biopolitical order that has in turn strongly shaped postcolonial biopolitical governance.9 This postcolonial biopolitics has given us new formations of contemporary biopolitics in India, the central preoccupation of this book. </p>

<li>a rchaic moDernities: science anD reLigion in contemPorary inDia</li>

</ol>
<p>In one of the many memorable lines from <em>Midnight’s Children</em>, Salman Rushdie (1981) argues that Indians have a poor sense of time and history, “No people whose word for ‘yesterday’ is the same as their word for </p>
<p>‘tomorrow’ can be said to have a firm grip on the time.” While true of some but not all Indian languages (for example, <em>kal</em> means “yesterday” and “tomorrow” in Hindi), this statement captures something important. Indians who visit the United States find the culture’s relationships to time and history strikingly different from their own. In its most obvious manifestation, in India we routinely see structures that are hundreds of years old, uncared for, and withering away in sight. In contrast, struc - tures just decades old in the United States are quickly memorialized, often with an entrance fee! To understand the Indian past is to enter time warps in which the “silent and evasive” pasts come to the fore in con - temporary India (Nandy 2001; Subramaniam 2017). Time-folding warps </p>
<p>are one of the critical ingredients of Hindu nationalism. Hindu national - ists bring the past and present together into one seamless story of a past sutured to the present, with a firm excision of the middle years of colonial - ism and conquest, in particular the histories of Islam. The historical record reveals a vastly more complex past. Repeatedly in the cases pre - sented in this book, temporalities are critical—shifts where the ancient and modern cohere. However, it is not only Indians who can live in multi - ple times. While it is rarely acknowledged to be the case, Europe does too (Chakrabarty 2001; Bauman 2013).</p>
<p>India’s archaic modernities and the articulations of the new <em>Hindutva</em> are transforming India’s foreign and domestic policies, as well as public and private lives. The coming together of science and religion is not only a personal vision but also one that brings configurations of science, reli - gion, and corporate and political power. For example, Baba Ramdev, a swami in saffron robes and a flowing beard, illustrates the archaic moder - nity I am trying to describe. He claims to be “scientific, secular, and uni - versal,” yet he also claims that he can “cure” homosexuality with yoga and has openly fantasized about beheading those who refuse to chant national - ist slogans (Crair 2018). A <em>sanyasi</em>, pledged to spend the rest of his life as a Hindu ascetic, he is also a yoga megastar on national TV, yet he has also been accused of violence, including murder. Nonetheless, he controls and is the public face of Patanjali Ayurved Ltd., a multibillion-dollar cor - poration that celebrates ancient Vedic heritage through consumer products including toothpaste, hand soap, floor cleaners, toilet cleaners, and more </p>
<p>recently instant noodles, organic grains, pulses, and herbs. Baba Ramdev argues that he runs the company not as a CEO runs a business but as a “guru runs an ashram.” Employees are forbidden to eat meat or drink alco - hol, and their labor is a form of <em>sewa</em>, or spiritual service, com manding lower salaries as a result (Crair 2018). There is now an explosion of consumer products based on Ayurvedic principles. Even foreign multina - tionals have created Ayurvedic consumer products: Colgate’s Veds hakti toothpaste, Lever’s Ayush toothpaste, Tresemme’s Botanique, and Clinic Plus’s Ayurveda (Sachitanand 2017). He effectively uses the mantle of <em>swadeshi</em> (or Indian economic nationalism) to reframe foreign companies as neocolonial villains (Worth 2018), effectively creating a “state-temple- corporate complex” (Nanda 2011). This quintessential blending of science, religion, and capitalism in an archaic modernity is in view throughout contemporary India. </p>
<p>To be sure, I do not want to suggest an abrupt and sudden arrival of an archaic modernity. Rather, the idea itself can be said to have multiple temporalities. Indeed, throughout India’s history, in multiple versions and visions, the past and future have cohered. Many Indian thinkers and lead - ers have rightfully celebrated and drawn from South Asia’s significant his - torical, cultural, and philosophical heritage. At independence, in refusing to call the country Hindustan and claiming for itself the older name of India or Bharat, the nation presented itself as an inevitable, organic out - come of national movements since the late nineteenth century. Thus, even while Pakistan emerged as a “new” nation, “India seemed young only in age, but ancient in spirit” (Chakrabarty 2018). As we see in chapter 1, the Indian nationalist movement, in attempting to blunt the claims of colonial - ism, drew on India’s ancient history to claim a superior civilization. Nehru (1959), despite being staunchly secular, mul ticultural, and a strong supporter of science and technology, tempered his passionate embrace of science with a celebration of the wisdom of ancient India. In his <em>Discovery of India</em>, </p>
<p>he waxed eloquent about the unique contributions, rich heritage, and philosophical and cultural significance of ancient India (Nehru 1989). In contrast, Marxist historian of science Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya brought past and present together in a different way (R. Prasad 1993). Rather than characterize the past as idyllic and harmonious, Chattopadhyaya </p>
<p>emphasized class struggle and the vibrancy, debates, and clash of ideas that animated Hindu philosophy.10 Thus, the temporalities of India have always defied a linear historical narrative.</p>
<p>There have been profound political and economic shifts in India since the increasing liberalization and globalization of its markets starting in the 1990s. The imbrications of nation, science, and religion have largely worked together to respond to this globalized phase of capital. It is impor - tant for us to understand the deeply entrenched logics of <em>Hindutva</em> beyond the politics of the current government or the BJP. I hope that the book, as it unfolds, presents <em>Hindutva</em> as a deeply embedded ideology, sometimes unnamed and at other times (like the contemporary moment) overde - termined, but always entangled with other forces such as capital, Euro - centrism, orientalism, postcolonialism, “third-world” politics, pressures from global financial institutions, and trade laws. The proliferation of Hindu swamis and gurus, and their capitalist and consumerist infrastruc - tures, help elevate and domesticate nationalism into the folds of everyday life and a “biomoral consumerism” (Khalikova 2017).</p>

<p>Soon after independence, Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first prime minister, famously declared India’s massive hydroelectric dams and gleaming new national scientific laboratories the “modern temples” of India, built in “service of our motherland” (D’Souza 2008; Arnold 2013). Fifty years later, </p>
<p>Pope John Paul II, during his visit to India, sat down with the leaders of ten other religions. All the leaders were men, and they met in the capital’s Hall of Science. Seventy years after independence, a Hindu nationalist government emerged, running on a platform of “develop ment national -</p>
<p>ism.” These three moments serve as important signposts for postcolonial India. In each, we see the visible entanglements of science and Hinduism. How should we understand the very visible and public encounters of two institutions—science and religion—in India? </p>
<p>While Hindu nationalists are reinvigorating a vision of archaic moder - nities in contemporary India, the intertwined histories of science and reli - gion run deeper. As Gyan Prakash (1999) argues, “Standing as a metaphor </p>
<p>for the triumph of universal reason over enchanting myths, science appears pivotal in the imagination and institution of India, a defining part of its history as a British colony and its emergence as an independent nation.” Indeed, during India’s freedom struggle, the nationalists opposed British colonialism in the name of “reason” and claimed “reason” as an Indian invention, not a Western one (M. Chatterjee 2000). They claimed that India’s ancient history had “followed, if not pioneered, a univ  ersal spirit leading to the nation-state, republicanism, economic development, and nationalism that reaffirmed cunning of Reason; and [they asserted] that a ‘backward’ country like India could modernize itself, if liberated from colonial slavery” (Prakash 1990: 391). Unlike linear diffusion models (Basalla 1967) that imagined colonized countries as passive grounds for the imposition of a “superior” Western science and civilizational logics, India (and indeed all colonized countries) clashed and resisted (Raina 1996, 1999, 2003; Raj 2001; Philip 2004; Chakrabarti 2004; Raina and Habib 2006; Prasad 2008; Chambers and Gillespie 2000; Loomba 2015). Rather, science in India progressed through “negotiations” and a process of “hybridiza - tion” rather than any wholesale imposition by the West. </p>
<p>Historians of colonial science have, by now, amply demonstrated that we can no longer assert a unique “Western” genealogy for modern techno - sciences. Instead, technosciences were already global by the nineteenth century (Teresi 2001; Mukharji 2016). Colonial science in India tugged </p>
<p>the technosciences away from their Western roots and combined it with Indian, specifically Hindu, forms of knowledge (Prakash 1990). This evolv - ing new science was not simply derivative of the West. It “drew its author - ity from a reworking of India’s ‘archaic’ traditions and a re-siting of these within the matrix of the modern nation. India’s modernity, with science </p>
<p>at its core, was thus at one and the same time both Indian and Western” (Arnold 2000: 162). My book is inspired by the work of South Asian schol - ars who have documented the rich local and vernacular cosmologies of South Asia (Arnold 1993, 1996; Philip 2004; Aditya Bharadwaj 2016; Sur 2011; Philip, Irani, and Dourish 2012; Abraham 2013; Phalkey 2013; S. Pinto 2014; A. Prasad 2014; Mukharji 2016). Ambivalence and hybridity are the hallmark of such engagements. </p>
<p>While the colonized resisted any easy imposition of science by colonial powers, colonial powers have historically controlled the narratives of </p>
<p>science and its biopolitical imperatives. Colonial policies were fundamen - tally biopolitical in nature, producing biological “difference” and keeping those differences in their “proper” places (Adas 1989; Schiebinger 1989, 1993; Stepan 1991; W. Anderson 1995; Sylvester 2006). In countries like India where the colonial enterprise depended heavily on the involvement of natives for governance, colonizers simultaneously maintained that the natives were worthy objects for their civilizing mission yet could never be actually civilized completely (Prakash 1999). Natives were always seen </p>
<p>as “fixed” and static while the European character was never fixed and was open to growth and change (Stoler 2002). Theories of biological superior - ity and inferiority produced ideologies of difference—of sex, race, caste, sexuality, class, nation—determining which bodies were capable of being subjugated (Hammonds 1999; Harding 1993; Stepan 1982). Claims of “irra - tional” natives, with “hot” temperaments and promiscuous sexualities, bolstered logics of difference and thus colonial subjugation. The deep misogyny that shaped male colonists is reproduced in policies of citizen - ship, governance, and public and private rights, and ultimately of the embodied subjectivities of colonizers and colonized (W. Anderson 2002b, </p>
<p>2007; Stepan 1982; Harding 2008, 2012). Deeply entrenched in theories of </p>
<p>the natural sciences, the legacies of these colonial ideologies of difference continue to haunt contemporary biological theories of difference (Sub - ramaniam 2014). In sum, we should understand the sciences as “sciences </p>
<p>of empire” (Schiebinger 2004) or as “Northern ethnosciences” (Harding 1997) that have fundamentally developed in a “colonial context” (Seth 2009; Philip 2004). In the colonies, the colonizers’ logic of difference merged with local hierarchies of difference to create new biopolitical regimes. For example, in the Indian context, theories of racial differences confronted hierarchies of caste to produce new theories and scientific analogies between race and caste.</p>
<p><em>Science and the Postcolonial</em> </p>
<p>Given that science and technology have been “the jewels in the crown of modernity” (Harding 2012: 2), central to the expansion of empire and critical to the contemporary world (Schiebinger 2005; Schiebinger and Swan 2005; Harding 2008; Subramaniam 2015b; Foster 2017), how do these colonial ideologies shape postcolonial India? There is little agreement </p>
<p>among scholars on what we mean by <em>postcolonial science</em> (Abraham 2013) </p>
<p>or, for that matter, by <em>colonial science</em> (Phalkey 2013). While not a seamless continuation of colonial science, postcolonial science may be understood as science “rephrased within the framework of globalization,” making visible colonial ontologies that live on in other guises and names (Ander - son and Adams 2007). Postcolonial studies of science offer us “flexible and contingent frameworks” to better understand the travels and mult i ple “contact zones” of technoscience and empire across laboratories, cultures, societies, and nations, where these encounters across difference have engendered new cultural forms (Pratt 1992; Verran 2001, 2002; W. Ander - son 2009). </p>
<p>A critical reason for colonialism’s immense and enduring power is that the elites of postcolonial states embraced science and technology as a central mode of modernity and development (Abraham 1998, 2006; Droney 2014; S. Roy 2007). While colonial and postcolonial STS have in recent years challenged and renarrated the history of science from earlier hagiographies of the superiority of Western science and its linear diff usion to the colonies, the old colonial hagiographies still predominate in India’s own elite histories of science (Prasad 2014). This book, in the tradition of recent work in postcolonial STS, seeks to displace these older imaginings of Western supremacy with new accounts that emphasize the resistance, hybridity, and contested nature of science in India (STHV 2016). Yet colo - nial policies do endure in the civilizing logics of contemporary inter - national development projects (W. Anderson 2009; Escobar 1995), and contemporary scientific theories and practices continue to show the deep legacies of colonialism (Harding 2008, 2012; Traweek 1988). Contemporary scientific institutions and education in postcolonial countries often rein - force models of “Western science,” replicating Eurocentric models of institu - tions and knowledge in postcolonial contexts and naturalizing science as “Western science” (Mutua and Swadener 2004; N. Kumar 2009; Thomas 2016, 2017; Krishna and Chadha 2017). The enduring legacies of colonial science in postcolonial India remain deeply fraught and debated. </p>
<p>Early third-world critics of science placed the failure of postcolonial states squarely at the feet of science and technology as a mode of post - colonial national development (Alvares 1992; Nandy 1988; Shiva 1989; Mies and Shiva 1993; Viswanathan 1997). In this more radical critique, critics </p>
<p>argued that postcolonial nations embraced science and technology as the “reason of state” (Nandy 1988) and with it embraced the “violence” of Western science (Shiva 1989; Alvares 1992). Arguing that science and tech - nology enabled colonialism, they contend that the third world has been poorly served by modern science and technology, its philosophies, policies, and practices, and are responsible for the economic, political, social, and cultural regress of formerly colonized countries (Harding 2009). These critics contend that postcolonial nations need to retreat from the hege - monic structures of science in order to truly “decolonize” formerly colo - nized worlds and their knowledge systems. </p>
<p>Decolonization is important, these scholars argue, because it will liberate and develop indigenous, alternate, and local knowledge systems. However, other postcolonial critics argue that this more radical position in many ways reinforces the binaries of center and periphery, West and East. They point to the inherent nativism in these narratives, wherein Western science and technology is always destructive and oppressive while local knowledge systems are always good and liberatory (Nanda 2001, 2003; Phalkey 2013). Postcolonial STS challenges us to move the binary logic to understand the center and periphery as co-constituted, the periph - ery continually remaking the “center” (Raina 1996; Philip 2004; Abraham 2006). Rather than locate the postcolonial in the third world, they have stressed the circulation of an increasingly transnational science and the creation of new complex formations that resist easy categorization (Fuji - mura 2000; Raj 2013; Prasad 2014). </p>
<p>Perhaps the best-developed ideas surround recent discussions of “Asia as method,” a plan to reorient STS so that Asia isn’t just a geograph - ical site for data extraction or a place where European concepts diffuse </p>
<p>(K. Chen 2010; W. Anderson 2017). These discussions have pushed STS </p>
<p>to rethink science studies in more relational terms—to take into account contested and politicized terrains of history and contested claims of the past. Chen (2010) suggests that “using Asia as an imaginary anchoring point can allow societies in Asia to become one another’s reference points” (xv), thus multiplying “frames of reference in our subjectivity and world - view, so that anxiety over the West can be diluted, and productive critical work can move forward” (223). While paying heed to the dangers of nar - ratives framed as a “clash” of knowledges of West and East, and wary of </p>
<p>conceptions that bolster essentialized views of “Asian values” (Abraham 2006: 210), scholars have nonetheless continued to build a substantial body of work focusing on science in Asia. Indeed, the frame of bionational - ism was first articulated in the Asian context, centered on countries using biomedical technoscience to optimize population health and to aggres - sively defend the nation against attacks from the outside (Gottweis 2009; Gottweis and Kim 2009). Indeed, the journal  <em>New Genetics and Society</em> (2009) devoted an entire issue, <em>Biopolitics in Asia</em>, to exploring the tre - mendous resources and development poured into science and technology in China, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam, and India. The successes of Asian science have not gone unnoticed, engendering calls within STS to develop a postcolonial version of the principle of symmetry so that Asia is not continually understood through the lens of the West and domi - nated conceptually, linguistically, corporeally, metaphysically, and insti - tutionally by Euro-American thought (Law and Lin 2017). This book responds to these calls.</p>
<p><em>Tracing the Contours of Bionationalism: Summary of the Case Studies</em></p>
<p>Rather than reanimate the antagonistic debates over whether science or religion will triumph, I suggest that the critical question is not <em>whether</em> the two are related but rather <em>how</em>. Over the last three decades, I have tracked the biological sciences in India. Five illustrative cases animate this book, each exploring various dimensions of bionationalism. In chapter 1, “Home and the World: Modern Lives of the Vedic Sciences,” I show how bio - nationalism includes visions of scientific development, best exemplified in the election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who ran on a platform of development nationalism. Promising scientific “development,” Modi brings together claims of the greatness of the Vedic sciences and promises of a scientific modernity. Using the case of Vaastushastra, or the Vedic “science” of architecture, I examine the valorizing of Vaastu as a modern- day “Vedic science” and its commodification in contemporary India as the best of the ancient and modern, an exemplar of an archaic modernity.</p>
<p>In chapter 2, “Colonial Legacies, Postcolonial Biologies: The Queer Politics of (Un)Natural Sex,” I begin with the infamous Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. Introduced during colonial rule, it remained law until September 6, 2018, when the Supreme Court struck down the sections </p>
<p>that criminalized consensual homosexual sex between adults. As we shall see, other acts deemed “unnatural” and “against the order of nature” remain prohibited. But what is nature’s order? Scientific conceptions about “nature” and “human nature” shaped the penal code in its colonial forma - tion. I explore how modern Hindu nationalism, Christian and Victorian sexual politics, scientific theories of sex and sexuality, and eugenic policies together shape the emerging bionationalism of sexual regulation. Colonial imaginaries through religion and science shape sex and sexuality. They reify “Indian” bodies and sexuality in opposition to the West, even as the West has shifted its cultural registers. </p>
<p>One of the sites that best illustrate the postcolonial predicament is environmental politics. Drawing on the mythology of the <em>Ramayana</em>, I explore the nativist politics that haunt postcolonial environmentalism. In </p>
<p>the debates surrounding of the building of the proposed Sethusamudram Shipping Canal between India and Sri Lanka, two sets of actors opposed </p>
<p>the construction—environmental scientists and religious activists, albeit for different reasons. In chapter 3, “Return of the Native: Nation, Nature, </p>
<p>and the Politics of Postcolonial Environmentalism,” I explore the debates over the proposed canal. A central point of contention focused on the underground rock formation at the bottom of the ocean that needed to </p>
<p>be destroyed to build the canal. Were these structures natural limestone shoals produced in the last Ice Age, or were they remnants of a bridge </p>
<p>built by Hanuman and his monkey army as narrated in the Indian epic <em>Ramayana</em>? This case powerfully demonstrates the strong animist tradi - tions of India, where claims of monkey gods and old mythologies emerge </p>
<p>as facts to be adjudicated by the courts. In a related case, I explore how demographic histories of caste are essentialized, orientalized, and taken up </p>
<p>in the biological literature as a case of ecological sustainability. Both cases together give us a complex picture of the nativism that undergirds post - colonial environmentalism.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, “Biocitizenship in Neoliberal Times: On the Making of the ‘Indian’ Genome,” perhaps best epitomizes bionationalism. Here I explore recent debates on the biological relationships between and among dif - ferent ethnic and caste groups of India, especially how these relationships relate to theories of an Aryan migration into India. This case demon - strates how old ethnic and caste categories get new life in the language of </p>
<p>genomics. Exploring two recent political debates on Indian genomics in India and the United States, I show how old politics of caste and race animate contemporary politics of belonging and are adjudicated through their biopolitical dimension, in the language of genes and genomics. I also explore the emergence of the Indian Genome Variation Project and proj - ects such as Ayurgenomics (aligning Ayurveda with modern genomics), tracing how bionationalism has empowered third-world nations to assert their genomic sovereignty in the face of global genomics. The government has aggressively promoted traditional Indian systems of medicine, includ - ing a 2017 bill that, if passed, will allow doctors practicing traditional medicine to prescribe allopathic medicine after a “bridge course.”</p>
<p>In chapter 5, “Conceiving a Hindu Nation: (Re)Making the Indian Womb,” by tracking the life of the “postcolonial womb,” I explore how “women” are figured in visions of an archaic modernity. How did the excesses of the Indian women’s undesirable hyperfertility of overpopula - tion get transformed into the desirable (re)productive site of the womb in neoliberal times? How does bionationalism transform the role of women from the victimized overpopulate, and the modern entrepreneur, to the sacred mother? We see how with the rise of Hindu nationalism, the new entrepreneur once again is transformed to dutiful wife, mother, and daugh - ter of family and nation. In a newer chapter to this history, we are witness - ing the rise of ancient Hindu gestational sciences such as <em>garbh sanskar</em>. The chapter explores the promotion and proliferation of these practices.</p>
<p>Indian biologists have vigorously contributed to these questions both within national biological research and through transnational alliances. Indeed, much of science today happens through transnational collabora - tions. Each of the five illustrative cases has led to public euphoria, debates, and contestations in which the ivory tower confronts local, national, and transnational politics. In exploring multiple facets of these five cases, I trace the production of scientific knowledge in and about India. The cases also reveal that the central preoccupations of the nation permeate debates on science and religion. Politics of gender, race, class, caste, sexuality, and indigeneity are deeply implicated in the projects of the nation, and in the alliances and tensions between science and religion. When the encounters of science and religion are examined through postcolonial eyes, science emerges as powerful and with multiple valences, but predictably, it is most </p>
<p>effective when its interests ally with other forms of power. The book acknowledges and traces these shared histories to uncover new circulations of science and its role in modernity.</p>

<li>secuLarism’s reLigion</li>

</ol>
<p>While <em>religion</em> is a ubiquitous term, scholars have a surprisingly difficult time defining it (Nongbri 2013). At its most capacious, “religion is a kind of inner sentiment or personal faith ideally isolated from secular concerns. In this common framework, the individual World Religions are thought of as specific manifestations of the general phenomenon of religion” (Nong - bri 2013: 7–8). But the definition ill represents religion’s profound entan - glements with politics and power. The enlightenment narrative, as Janet Jakobsen and Ann Pellegrini (2008) note, separates secularism from reli - gion, and through such a separation, secularism, like reason, is granted a universal status. In contrast, religion remains particular. Thus, religion emerges as secularism’s conjoined twin (Asad 1993). It is secularism that marks modernity’s “religion” as a discrete category and institution. Yet, as their insightful work demonstrates, the binary conceptions of secu - larism and religion are poorly reflected on the ground everywhere in the world. The “resurgence” of religion across the globe reveals tensions around the politics of secularism and its enactments.</p>
<p>In fully exploring the burgeoning Hindu nationalism in contemporary India, it is easy to overstate the case and not adequately capture India’s multireligious histories. For example, Sugirtharajah (2018) argues that Indians (and Asians more broadly) embraced the multiplicity of religions and made it their own. In India, Jesus was transformed into a Jain pilgrim and a Hindu mystic. Such transformations were an act of anticolonialism, “an intentional, deliberate, and dignified method of self-discovery and decolonisation in the face of colonial degradation.... Their articulations can be seen as a notable attempt at ‘provincializing Europe’ and a rejec - tion of the notion that only the West can prove the pathways to under - standing Jesus. These Asian thinkers demanded a different foundation for faith than history, logic, and neutrality” (Sugirtharajah 2018: 1–2). Sugirtha - rajah argues that through centuries of engagement, Christianity in India </p>
<p>has become “Indian” because the Indians have rigorously engaged its tenets, transforming it and adapting it to Indian sensibilities. We can similarly narrate the other religions in India to reveal how through cen - turies of practice, each has become deeply rooted in an Indian ethos. In this sense, they are every bit as “Indian” as Hinduism. Religions, like sci - ence, always come to develop new, locally inflected roots. </p>
<p>The founders of India constituted a democratic country with a secular and pluralistic vision that was to actively include, support, and encourage all religions (in contrast to an American model of a separation of church and state) (Das Acevedo 2013). The legal system includes exceptions for religious personal law in areas of marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption, and maintenance. Despite this inclusive vision, there is little doubt that religious intolerance has always persisted. In contemporary India, reli - gious minorities are harassed, intimidated, and sometimes killed in the name of the majority Hindus (Peer 2014; Schultz and Raj 2017). Interreli - gious and intercaste relationships are often met with violence, and move - ments such as “love jihad” and “ghar wapsi” are orchestrated campaigns to maintain the social bounds of religion (Faleiro 2014). Even when indi - viduals convert to other religions from Hinduism, their caste origins (and social privileges and stigmas) travel with them. </p>
<p>I use the term <em>religion</em> in this more capacious understanding as a social and intellectual institution with multiple genealogies and valences. In particular, I draw on recent theorizations of religion from STS. First, I engage with religion as a set of social practices that have been integrated into mainstream culture and everyday life. Throughout this book, we see how everyday forms of religiosity are intertwined in structures of bio - divinity, such as Vaastushastra, an ancient science of architecture that gets incorporated into ideals of the modern home, or how people (includ - ing doctors) may pray in their quest for fertility or good health, or how everyday practices of religious life work as principles of conservation and sustainability. Religion in India—or indeed in any part of the world—is rarely set apart from life, politics, or science.</p>
<p>Renny Thomas (2016), in his insightful ethnography of Indian scien - tists, demonstrates that science does not replace religion in India but lives alongside it in an easy and effortless cohabitation. He argues that one sees </p>
<p>the limits of conceptions of Western atheism in capturing the everyday life of scientists. Indian scientists insist on a more engaged relationship with religion because, they argue, it makes them better scientists—for example, by preparing them to deal with complex ideas such as the “infinite” (which is unpredictable, unfathomable, complex, and not mea - surable) or through mediating “their ego and jealousy” (Thomas 2017). Indeed, scholars have noted such imbrications of science and religion throughout the world. As Elizabeth Roberts (2016: 209) eloquently describes in her work on assisted reproduction in Ecuador, “I came to understand that God was part of the action. Lab biologists included God in the process of assisted reproduction, since ‘all of nature was thanks to him.’” And Natasha Myers’s (2015) careful ethnography of the life sciences, <em>Rendering Life Molecular</em>, reminds us how scientists in the West ultimately willfully fail to “disenchant their practice or deanimate their objects.” Indeed, despite the Enlightenment, STS reminds us that the “objective” sciences  have  not  succeeded  in  entirely  dis-enchanting  our  deeply enchanted world. Despite science’s avowed secularism, these works remind us of the enduring Judeo-Christian legacies in the sciences (Noble 1992; Hannam 2009).</p>
<p>Second, I explore religion in its more politicized incarnations when it is mobilized toward larger national and instrumental goals. The heart of the book examines how ideas of the native and indigenous are mobi - lized into a potent form of bionationalism. Finally, the book draws on contemporary scholars’ critiques of the binaries of the religious and the secular. Scholars have underscored that theorization of “religion” in STS rarely embraces the range of social practices, spaces, and beliefs that are connected to sacrality in many non-Western regions, for example, in seeking to recover the differences between words like <em>dharma</em>, <em>mazhab</em>, <em>karma</em>, etc. that do not map precisely onto religion.11 Indeed, this con - ceptualization of religion is well laid out in Ian Whitmarsh and Elizabeth Roberts’s (2016) advocacy for a “nonsecular anthropology.” They argue that “secular” science/medicine is predicated and relies on religious traditions to produce science’s political secularity. Rather than an areligious institu - tion, Western science emerges from genealogies of Christianity, and West - ern scientific and medical practices are deeply embedded in Christian ideologies and mores. Indeed, the idea of secularism is itself constructed </p>
<p>and shaped by specific Christian traditions (Jakobsen and Pellegrini 2008). As Whitmarsh and Roberts (2016: 203) argue, “Within this ana - lytic, the secular does not serve as a simple contrast, a word for whatever </p>
<p>is not religious. Instead the secular is what claims to craft ‘the religious’ as its object, asserting itself as equally positioned vis-à-vis all religions.” <em>Holy Science</em> builds on this work to better articulate within STS how the allegedly separate zones of the secular and the religious are coconstituted. Indeed, these disjunctures become all the more apparent in dealing with non-Christian cosmologies. For example, Jean Langford (2016), in analyz- ing death in the modern hospital, explores the medicalization of the soul. She shows how Western hospitals reveal their latent Christian theological presuppositions when confronted with patients who are adherents of alternate cosmologies about the body and soul, life, and death. Christian theology thus gets encoded in the mask of secular science. Throughout this book, we encounter the limits of Western secular STS to deal with postcolonial and alternate cosmologies and frameworks.</p>

<li>Lost in transLation: the eLusive Language oF the coLoniaL anD PostcoLoniaL</li>

</ol>
<p>I should state clearly at the outset that in uncovering India, and in explor - ing the many elisions and erasures in its histories, genealogies, traditions, and practices, I inevitably reinforce the idea of a monolithic “West”—one that is hierarchical and riddled in binary logics, and in which modern, scientific, and abstract thought have deep and enduring roots. As I have circulated this manuscript to colleagues who work in other national, reli - gious, and regional contexts, I have been struck by the numbers of times they have scribbled or commented in the margin, “But this is also true of X, Y, Z.” Yes, this is a book about India, but it is written firmly within the shared contexts across the “postcolonial.” Similarly, the major religions share characteristics. While the intimate context of this book may be India, its content speaks to these global shared histories.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the West is also multiple, polyvocal, and nonmodern in its own way (Haraway 1985, 2003; Harding 1991, 1998; Herzig 2005; Latour 1993). Despite this truism and the call to provincialize Europe almost two decades ago, discussions of a monolithic “West” lives on. The </p>
<p>spirit of the book responds to how these larger topologies of West and East remain central and enduring civilizational logics that haunt aca - demia. They have shaped not only colonial justifications but also disci - plinary practices. For example, in discussing theories of the novel and </p>
<p>its form, Amit Chaudhuri (2017) insightfully observes that when great - ness is bestowed on a European novelist, it is to credit the novelist with “innovations in the form.” In contrast, the Indian novelist is seen as writing only “about India.” Innovations of the European novel are seen </p>
<p>not as an assertion of Europe but as contributions to the universal form of the novel itself. Formal innovations in a non-European novel may at </p>
<p>best be credited with having “a European air.” With the growth of Amer - ican writers and the centrality of the Anglophone world of the USA, it </p>
<p>has joined Europe, and so “we don’t think of innovations in fiction emerging from these locations as being primarily connected to what it means to be a New Yorker, or an American—we think of them as formal innovations in themselves.” Chaudhuri concludes, “The American writer has succeeded the European writer. The rest of us write of where we come from.” </p>
<p>Postcolonial scholars have made the same argument from multiple disciplinary locations. It is true of the field of history, where “Europe remains the sovereign theoretical subject of all histories, including the ones we call ‘Indian,’ ‘Chinese,’ ‘Kenyan,’ and so on . . . all these other histories tend to become variations on a master narrative that could be called ‘the history of Europe’. In this sense ‘Indian’ history itself is in a position of subalternity; one can only articulate subaltern positions in the name of this history” (Chakrabarty 1992).</p>
<p>Anthropology has long constituted the European center through the demarcation of the “primitive” other. Sociology, political science, econom - ics, and virtually all disciplines constitute their fields through universal theories of the Enlightenment and with Europe and the West at their </p>
<p>center. As historians of science have shown, we see this pattern literally written on the body by the machineries of science and technology. In the biological sciences, hierarchies of bodies and their capabilities were  written into conceptions of an evolutionary ladder or a “great chain of being.” The “higher races” were capable of rational abstract thought, while lower races were more animal-like, more of the earth, closer to </p>
<p>nature (Schiebinger 1993). Women also ranked below men in these capaci - ties (Schiebinger 1989). Thus, third-world peoples and races, and similarly women, are always seen as closer to nature, more grounded in the mate - rial body, and its sensory and affective apparatus, and less in the mind (Hamilton, Subramaniam, and Willey 2017). The normative body was always the elite European, and the white European heterosexual couple represented the pinnacle of evolution (Markowitz 2001). Only Europ  ean bodies marked superior beings, and only European science made the rules.</p>
<p>Similarly, modernity belongs to the West. If others showed some aspects of it, they may have “alternate” modernities or display “multiple” modernities, or in my invention here “archaic” modernities, but the idea of modernity as inherently Western remains canonical. These “rules” of knowledge were not lost on the colonized. Colonized subjects often claimed their own modernity. We see claims to Islamic modernism, Hindu modernism, and so on. But as Lila Abu-Lughod (1998: 128) writes, “these alternate versions were often written off as failed imitations of the west—failures of secularism, of nationalism, or of enlightened mod - ernities. From such language of failures, we need to move to expand our repertoire of modernities, to capture more of the many entangled histories of west and the rest.” This repertoire must also capture the “the ambiva - lences, contradictions, use of force and the tragedies and the ironies that attend to it” (Chakrabarty 1992). Understanding Indian biona tionalism is one such attempt.</p>
<p>If the colonized and the postcolonized are forever to write in the lan - guage of the colonizer, is much lost in this translation? I will confess that as an evolutionary biologist trained in “Western” biology in India and the United States, the answer surprised me perhaps more than most. While this book is written in English (and quite honestly my very postcolonial urban education precludes me from writing a whole book on biology in any other language), I am deeply aware of my inability to translate life and language on the ground in India at every step of the way. I have per - severed, but it seems an impossible challenge. Writing in the master’s tongue, perhaps I could at least subvert the master’s tools and genres? Feminist studies offers generative scholarship in the visionary works of scholars such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Audre Lorde, Cherríe Moraga, Octavia Butler, and Suniti Namjoshi, who have opened up writing as a site of </p>
<p>epistemological challenge, political possibilities, and indeed a necessity for survival. Writing opens up new imaginaries, liberatory landscapes, and paths of resistance. As Anzaldúa (1983) powerfully writes in “Speaking in Tongues: A Letter to 3rd World Women Writers”:</p>
<p>Why am I compelled to write?... Because the world I create in  the writing compensates for what the real world does not give me. By writing I put order in the world, give it a handle so I can grasp it. I write because life does not appease my appetites and hunger. I write... To become more intimate with myself and you.To discover myself, to preserve myself, to make myself, to achieve self-autonomy. To dispel the myths that I am a mad prophet or a poor suffering soul. To convince myself that I am worthy and that what I have to say is not a pile of shit.... Finally, I write because I’m scared of writing but I’m more scared of not writing.</p>
<p>Inspired by their work, the experiments in this book attempt to destabilize the neat categories of the Western academy, helping us reanimate histories and theories to make the familiar unfamiliar and the unfamiliar familiar. I find it best to describe this with a visual metaphor. Later in this chapter, in developing a naturecultural methodology, I draw on the organic forms of plant thigmotropism (Subramaniam 2014)—the touch sensitivity of organisms, especially plants with tendrils that scale large surfaces through tactile means. Through their thigmotropic tendrils, climb ing plants pro - duce a dense braid or weave of organic matter. I have found this an apt metaphor for postcolonial science. Western science when imposed on India was not rejected, but it did not fully “translate” into local contexts either. As the thigmotropic tendrils of Western knowledge scaled Indian cul - tural and knowledge landscapes, they produced an uneven weave of Western and Eastern knowledge systems. Much was “lost in translation.” There are thus many gaps and holes and many dense thickets and knots. A singular challenge has been communicating the many ways in which Western “universal” science re-emerges in India with local inflections, and in deeply uneven and heterogeneous terrain.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, I want to name here the particular concepts, ontol - ogies, and ideas that have been the toughest to translate. I use the </p>
<p>terminology that is by now well established in cultural and feminist theo - ries of science, but I want to flag their inadequacy even as I adopt them in the rest of this book. The prefix <em>bio</em> (biology, biopower, biopolitics, bionationalism) is perhaps central, at the heart of my disciplinary training in the biological sciences, and the critical focus of this book. In English, the root is the Greek <em>bios</em>, which refers to the form or manner in which life is lived, finite and mortal, contrasted with <em>zoē</em>, the biological fact of life, infinite and a general phenomenon of life. In outlining the concept of biopolitics and biopower, Foucault argued that in politics in the eighteenth century, Western societies consolidated power into a new medical author - ity, a scientized discourse of disease, and a new institutional power for science and medicine. Foucault chronicles how the growth of industrial capitalism ushered in new forms of power that constitute life and death, i.e., biopower (Foucault [1976] 1998). This shift in power marked the ascen - dency of the life sciences, giving them a central role in constituting life, the body, and health. In more recent times, Agamben (1995) has argued that in Western thinking, the distinction between the two roots of “life,” <em>bios</em> and <em>zoē</em>, is increasingly lost, and as a result “life” is more or less exclu - sively in the realm of the biological dimensions—and there are no guar - antees about the quality of life or <em>bios</em>. This constitution of a more scientific and medical conception of life does not fully translate into the Indian context. As I explored biopolitics in India, I encountered many dense knots and threads of incommensurability. We can observe this at three different levels. First, in Hindi, many words broadly translate the English <em>life</em>, such as <em>zindagi</em>, <em>jeevan</em>, <em>pran</em>, <em>atma</em>, <em>rahen</em>, <em>josh</em>, <em>jaan</em>, and <em>aayushya</em>, as do the Tamil words <em>vazhkai</em>, <em>uyire</em>, and <em>ayul</em>. In part, this is because the Indian words continue to incorporate and embody ideas of soul, spirit, energy, and other vitalist notions of life (potentially inhabiting different bodies across generations), ideas long purged from Western definitions. Second, there is a distinct biopolitics of Hindu nationalism, a politics that is incor - porated in the body’s physiognomy, in biology and in practices of bodily discipline, as well as a biopower that governs populations and govern - ments in the Foucauldian sense. This “biopolitics” is not the same as the Foucauldian transformations in the nineteenth century in the West, but neither is it unrelated; the Indian context embodies a different genealogy of life and time into its conceptions. Finally, we have biopolitics of the </p>
<p>Indian State that engages with world trade laws, patent laws, transnational health initiatives, and rules of the World Health Organization, necessarily adopted for “Western” standards and trans national purposes. The census, biological variables of health and illness, population level indicators, and indices of national health all follow a Western template. Thus, “life” in India inhabits several registers, including untranslatable local understand - ings, various dimensions of biopolitics of Hindu nationalism, and a Fou - cauldian unfolding of Western global biopolitics. The politics of life on the ground in India reveals multiple elisions and erasures, and one finds that much is lost in translation.</p>
<p>We see such fissures, mistranslations, and knotty problems through - out the book. I have tried to explicate the Indian contexts whenever possible, but in reality, English does not have an equivalent vocabulary for India, nor the biological sciences the ontologies for these concepts. For example, the multiple sexual identities and ontologies in India, as we shall see in chapter 2, do not translate into the simple politics of “queer,” and neither is the term <em>queer</em> always intelligible in Indian contexts. Yet I embrace the term because <em>queer</em> has emerged as a capacious word to signal not only nonnormative identities but also a method that troubles easy definitions and opens up new constellations of meanings. But such short hands flatten the diversity and vitality of “life.” To adequately trans - late many of these terms would each take a chapter, and in some cases a whole book. Concepts of time, space, history, linearity, progress, nation, change, origin, death, and body all have different lives in India. In a country where ghosts, souls, and spirit worlds remain alive, and where processes such as reincarnation and transmigration of souls remain deeply revered, Western scientific concepts can never fully take root and thrive. Rather, they live on awkwardly and often violently alongside Indian ways of living in their multiplicities. Many of the fissures and knots of biopolitics in India that haunt this book are contests of such power. In the five illustrative cases that follow this introduction, ideas do not have unidirectional modes; rather, they travel back and forth between West and East endlessly. With each trip, something is lost and gained, translated and mistranslated, resulting in layered genealogies and histories of meaning.</p>

<p>If there is one lesson I’ve learned in the humanities it is that stories are never innocent. Claiming gods and goddesses is a political act. Embracing science as the site of reason or unreason is a political act. We live in politi - cal times as we sift through our gods and goddesses of religion and sci - ence. Narrating origin stories, adjudicating history, and telling stories of the past, present, and future through the powers of science or divine intervention are deeply political acts. Each enables possibilities often fore - closed through the other. </p>
<p>When I was introduced to the humanities as a biologist, a central insight I had was on the power of narratives and storytelling. But nar - ratives, I have come to discover, are not the sole purview of the humani - ties. Indeed, science and scientific papers are fundamentally a narrative </p>
<p>about nature and the natural world. As Donna Haraway (1989: 5) astutely notes:</p>
<p>Biology is inherently historical, and its form of discourse is inher - ently narrative. Biology as a way of knowing the world is kin to </p>
<p>Romantic literature, with its discourse about organic form and func - tion. Biology is the fiction appropriate to objects called organisms; biology fashions the facts “discovered” from organic beings. Organ - isms perform for the biologist, who transforms that performance into a truth attested by disciplined experience; i.e., into a fact, the jointly accomplished deed or feat of the scientists and the organism. Romanticism passes into realism, and realism into naturalism, genius into progress, insight into fact. Both the scientist and the organism are actors in a story-telling practice.</p>
<p>Narratives in this mode aren’t about fiction or the fantastical, but any plot— describing an experiment we conduct or a fictional world we imagine—is inherently about narrative. Narratives narrate; they tell a story. How nar - ratives unfold, what is included in and excluded from them, and why, where, and when they are narrated is shaped by convention; in academia, con - vention belongs in the realm of disciplines. Genres of writing—scientific experiments, social science studies, literary analyses, creative writing— are deeply disciplinary modes of knowledge production. Claims of truth or falsehood, robustness or lack thereof, and rigor or weakness are famil - iar territory for feminist STS. Feminist and postcolonial STS offer us robust epistemological critiques of science even while passionately insist - ing on the need for interdisciplinary and contextualized knowledge pro - cesses, albeit partial, situated, and contingent (Haraway 1988). </p>
<p><em>Braided Sciences, Helical Stories, Thigmotropic Knowledge:  Toward an Experimental Humanities</em></p>
<p>Narratives have emerged as a central mode of politics. In chronicling how narrative has moved from literature to politics, John Lancaster (2011) remarks, “We no longer have debates, we have conflicting narratives.” As we will see in the five cases in this book, the challenges of scientific knowledge lie not only in the data and their salience but in how scientists and other actors narrate those data in the stories they tell. Three decades of work in feminist STS have highlighted the power of understanding scientific experimentation and knowledge making as narrative. The nar - ratives of scientific papers are not innocent but emerge out of particular commitments to Enlightenment logics. It has led me to imagine an experi - mental humanities (here an experimental biohumanities) in bringing together empiricism and analytic conventions of experiments from the sci - ences and the rhetorical and contextual analyses from the humanities. </p>
<p>As a biologist interested in producing knowledge about the natural world, I am compelled by decades of analyses in the feminist and social studies of science that reveal that science is not a value-neutral or unbi - ased enterprise. Rather, we need to expand the methods and methodol - ogies of scientific training to engage a larger repertoire that a vibrant interdisciplinarity allows. One of the profound lessons I learned in exam - ining the history of biology in <em>Ghost Stories for Darwin</em> (Subramaniam 2014) </p>
<p>was the richness of biological thought. The sciences are often far more diverse in their theories, opinions, practitioners, and politics, and more contentious and full of debate, than the official histories of science or biology often narrate. Similarly, studies of how science is communicated, how scientific ideas travel and circulate, reveal the inextricable connections among science and larger cultural and social forces. “Science” has also emerged as a site of such epistemic authority that everyone has embraced it—we have Western science, indigenous sciences, Christian science, Vedic sciences, Hindu science, Islamic science, queer science, third-world sci - ence, postcolonial science, and so on. In the proliferation of sciences, much is lost and gained; the move to embrace the word <em>science</em> is a politi -</p>
<p>cal project of epistemic authority, and sometimes of obfuscation; the word should always be read with these multiple valences unless otherwise specified. There are many claims to “science,” and understanding what science is, who practices it, and why and how science is supported or chal - lenged in various contexts has emerged as a key question of our times.</p>
<p>In exploring these larger questions of science in this book, I engage the analytic powers of biology and the humanities through an examina - tion of narratives. What stories does science tell about itself? How does </p>
<p>it narrate biology and nature? How does science get narrated in various contexts? Who tells science’s stories, and why and how? I’m interested in </p>
<p>the complex and global circulations of scientific narratives. In addition, I’m interested in highlighting the multiple, contradictory, and conflicting narratives of science, by science, and about science. Finally, I’m inter - ested in the stories not told. What are the stories about science that get underplayed, minimized, or erased entirely? To understand the workings </p>
<p>of science through an attention to narrative, we need to expand our repertoire of storytelling practices. Versions of the stories in this book have been told elsewhere; yet when the same story is narrated through the theories of feminism, postcolonialism, and STS, something different emerges. That is the power and the purpose behind an experimental humanities.</p>
<p>Two sets of metaphors are striking in our recent understandings of science. First, as our understanding of networks, assemblages, and actor network theory has grown, we talk about science in the plural, and in its relationships with other objects (Luckhurst 2006). Metaphors include fabric </p>
<p>(Wilholt 2013), patchworks (Bauchspies and Bellacasa 2009), entangle - ments (Mamo and Fishman 2013), braided sciences (Mukharji 2016), and the game of cat’s cradle (Haraway 1994)—all of which remind us that the tapestries of science and scientific knowledge involve multiple threads, braids and weaving. Taken together, these metaphors remind us that science is not a purified knowledge that is transmitted untouched by social and political forces. Rather, histories, politics, and social structures are deeply woven into the fabric of science and the body politic. It is impos - sible to pull out “pure” knowledge from an intricate weave. Therefore, in discussing science, we need to examine science from all sides as its threads wind and unwind, tangle and untangle across time and space. We need to move from linear storytelling to helical stories as we track the various threads that make scientific knowledge (Gallais and Pollina 1974). </p>
<p>Second, we talk about science using metaphors of movement and mobility. Scholars have discussed contact zones (Pratt 1992), science in motion (Prasad 2008), a moving metropolis (MacLeod 2000), or science as circulation (Raj 2006). These works remind us that science is an evolv - ing enterprise—it moves, traveling across time and space. Postcolonial STS has powerfully documented that science is never exactly the same across contexts (W. Anderson 1998; Roberts 2012; Abraham 2013). Like </p>
<p>the thigmotropic tendrils of plants, the fibrils of science seek support structures, and thus come to scale political and social scaffolding in dif - ferent contexts. I use the term <em>fibril</em>, from botany, to highlight the organic, </p>
<p>living nature of knowledge as it travels and takes different shapes in differ - ent contexts. As science’s thigmotropic tendrils build infrastructures in </p>
<p>varied contexts, they build on the local terrains and scaffolding and organ - ically create dense knots and thickets of social meaning. Hence, while we interpret these knots as social categories—sex, gender, race, class, caste, sexuality—they are never the same across the world. Tracing science’s thigmotropism is important because it has been so central to producing </p>
<p>a politics of “difference” (Hamilton, Subramaniam, and Willey 2017).</p>
<p>Taken together, the two metaphors of entanglement and thigmotro - pism align with recent impulses in contemporary STS toward complex stories, toward tracking the entangled fabric of science and society and the migrations and circulations of science and scientific knowledge. Learn - ing to develop such “thick” descriptions necessitates the rich modes of </p>
<p>the humanities and the sciences. Indeed, it reminds us of why literature and science have long been important interlocutors even while a disciplin - ary academy has relegated them to mutually exclusive corners of the mod - ern university. </p>
<p>In using narrative as a mode of the experimental humanities, Anna Tsing’s (2015: 38) latest work is provocative in this regard:</p>
<p>To listen to a rush of stories is a method. Why not make the strong claim and call it a science, an addition to knowledge? Its research object is contaminated diversity; its unit of analysis is indeterminate encounter.... A rush of stories cannot be neatly summed up. Its scales do not nest neatly; they draw attention to interrupting geogra - phies and tempos. These interruptions elicit more stories. This is the rush of stories’ power as a science. Yet it is just these interruptions that step out of the bounds of most modern science, which demands the possibility for infinite expansion without changing the research framework.</p>
<p>The power of narratives is their ability to make the unfamiliar (scientific studies) familiar (stories) for the nonscientist and the familiar (scientific studies) into unfamiliar (stories) for the scientist. Both force us to locate scientific studies and the enterprise of science within their historical con - texts. Scientific narratives in the West draw from Judeo-Christian frame - works (Haraway 1997). The five illustrative cases that animate this book challenge the linear Judeo-Christian frameworks of progress toward greater truth. Rather, they remind us that other narratives exist, ones that travel, evolve, and are endlessly recursive and hyperlinked. Narrative practices in India are a good example. Indian mythological stories are primarily oral traditions. Narrated and renarrated, these tales traveled, mutated and transformed. When written down, they often emerged in mul tiple versions, the author of each tale imbuing it with a different ethos, and indeed with different story lines and details. Elite versions are rou - tinely challenged by more populist retellings.</p>
<p>Two modes of storytelling practices animate this book. First, as the opening rush of stories suggest, Indian mythology does not follow the lin - ear, Judeo-Christian-inspired storytelling practices of the West. Its many </p>
<p>modes are worth highlighting. First, there is no binary good and evil. Indeed, Indian mythology hosts deeply flawed gods, goddesses, and demons. Good and evil can reside in the same individual. As the <em>Bhagwad</em> </p>
<p><em>Gita</em> reveals, in the famous exchange between Arjuna and Lord Krishna, the goal of war may not even be justice or righteousness but the fulfill - ment of duty. Hindu mythology opens up other modes and goals of life </p>
<p>and living, not just the good vanquishing evil. The gray areas—those infinite spaces between zero and one, as Kabir’s opening epigraph to this </p>
<p>book beautifully illustrates—are the spaces of life and living. Second, the boundaries between human and nonhuman, animal and plant, and mate - rial and spirit are porous at best. Through transmorphing of bodies, trans - migration of souls, and reincarnation, individuals can move across bodies, </p>
<p>and their karma and dharma of life travel with them to new bodies and new futures. Third, there are stories within stories within stories. There </p>
<p>is no one linear story to be told. Stories may be repeated but always with variations—as a different character is highlighted and new unfolding story </p>
<p>utterly transforms the old one. Indian mythological stories are best under - stood as cyclical or helical stories; we can come back to them again and again, yet utterly anew. A narrative is not a simple logical operation; rather, </p>
<p>it is a discourse that unwinds. Each of the five illustrative cases here is a complex case. There are stories within stories that weave together into complex bionarratives of how science and religion are imbricated. Fourth, </p>
<p>life is not finite with a clear beginning and end, life and death; it can be reborn in new bodies. Mythological stories follow the same pattern. Recur - sivity is also a reminder that history repeats itself. Throughout this book </p>
<p>we see how old social categories, old histories, and old debates re-emerge in new biological variables, theories, and debates. While rebirth and rein - carnation can indeed lend stories their cyclical properties, so can the ghosts </p>
<p>caught in the cycles of injustice. The ghosts of misogyny, racism, colonial - ism, casteism, heterosexism, and other long-enduring historical forces </p>
<p>also live on (Subramaniam 2014).</p>
<p>The  second  storytelling  mode  that  animates  this  book  is  more organic—the thigmotropic properties of plants. In <em>Ghost Stories for Darwin</em>, </p>
<p>I acknowledge my debt to morning glories and the power of their tendrils to latch onto the scaffolding structures around their evolving mor phology (Subramaniam 2014). Morning glories will climb a pole in a linear form </p>
<p>if that is what is available; they will stay close to the ground and build matted networks through stalks of grass and weeds; or they will rise up as giant and imposing structures as they wind their way around their world. Sciences, like morning glories, are never pure as they travel and interact with other local and contextual knowledge systems to produce a wondrous array of helical stories and thigmotropic knowledges. Projit Mukharji (2016: 27), in his evocative description of “braided sciences,” describes knowledge systems as “multi-stranded spools selectively braided together by the presence of the ‘entangled objects.’ But this braid - ing in turn also transforms the objects themselves, giving them new meanings and transforming the relations between the two cultural entities being crossed.” Like morning glories, science’s thigmotropic tendrils are entangled in different biological, social, cultural, and political forma - tions and imbricated in local genealogies, histories, cultures, and politics. Indeed, the braided sciences of South India are different from those of the North. There is no universal story; it is different each time. </p>
<p>Tracing the layered histories through science allows us to see how our narratives of “biology”—what it is and its relation to the world—change over time. At any historical moment, scientific ideas are always multiple, always contested. Indeed, as scholars have reread old scientific texts, other possibilities, sometimes more progressive and imaginative, emerge (Grosz 2011; Hustak and Myers 2012). While particular ideas win out at particular moments, it is important to remember the richness and plurality of sci - entific thought. Other options, other futures, were always possible. </p>
<p>Finally, the book attempts to embody the multiple narratives and entangled histories of science and religion in its thigmotropic structures as it weaves fiction with nonfiction and multiple but related tales within each chapter. I have incorporated not only inspirations of Indian modes of storytelling but stories themselves. Indian mythological stories have both progressive and regressive elements. While a more virulent form of Hindu nationalism embraces some mythologies in order to purge India of other religions and recast India as a Hindu nation, other possibilities also exist. The opening descriptions of Indian mythologies, and the Avatar stories interspersed between the main chapters, are attempts at presenting an “elsewhere,” alternate sites where scientific and religious thought may come together not in the hypernationalist modes but in alternative cadences </p>
<p>of Indian storytelling. As you will see, the stories aren’t quite religious mythology (if aliens were gods, they could easily be!) but are more in the vein of speculative fiction, deeply inspired by mythology and science. </p>
<p>These experiments within the humanities reveal how historical pro - cesses shape a living and breathing science that evolves across time and space. We can now spin old stories anew, unravel and reweave new tapestries of nature, of biology, of the human and the world. The power of the experimental humanities is in its interdisciplinary methods and methodologies—to experiment, explore naturecultural worlds, while at the same time being deeply cognizant of what the humanities offer us: an attention to the histories of terms, theories, language, frameworks, and contexts. An experimental biohumanities refuses the idea that the cultural world does not matter to the sciences or the natural world to the humani - ties. There is critical value in studying them together. </p>

<p>One might say that the epistemic story of imperialism is the story of a series of interruptions, a repeated tearing of time that cannot be sutured. </p>
<p>gayatri sPiva K, <em>A Critique of Postcolonial Reason</em></p>
<p>I return to Modi’s claims of Hindu mythology as evidence for Vedic plastic surgery and genetic sciences with which I began this chapter. While it may be amusing, it opens up the possibilities of new imaginative worlds, albeit not in the supremacist mode that Modi often invokes. Whether one reads these stories as fact, fiction, myth, metaphor, or allegory, they can reveal a stunning and pluralistic imagination of the natural and cultural, of gender, sexuality, and kinship. In these worlds, the newer conceptions in Western science that create the binary realms of nature and culture, human and nonhuman, and scientific and spiritual mingle to create non - binary imaginations of naturecultural, human/nonhuman, and spiritual scientific worlds. If we think of these stories alongside what we may call biology, the body, the flesh or matter, these stories are generative and allow new naturecultural possibilities. Trees communicate with each other and other inhabitants on Earth. Human and nonhuman communication is </p>
<p>rampant. Reproduction is not always grounded in sex, heterosexuality, or heteronormative reproduction. Sex and gender are mutable. New bodies can emerge from tissues, through desire, through necessity, through long - ing, through invocation to the gods. Reproduction is possible in bodies of either gender or indeterminate genders, through nonmaterial ghostly worlds and magical spectral creatures. Reproduction is possible across vast spatial scales. Pregnancy can be entirely unmediated and possible outside of the ontologies of bodies. The metaphoric possibilities of epi - genetics are echoed in stories of fetuses in porous wombs, imbibing their cultural surroundings. </p>
<p>An experimental humanities helps us understand that there is no linear link between stories, their narrative power, and their interpretation. Stories are always interpreted through politics. None of the stories auto - matically unfold into the politically progressive or regressive. Indeed, stories of queer reproduction can reinforce heteronormativity, epigenetics can reinforce patriarchal ideals, and human/animal interactions can rein - force essentialist ideas of species. What excites me about these stories is not that they are an a priori site of radical politics but that they eschew a singular hegemonic narrative and open up the possibilities of other worlds and other ways of living as legitimate and possible—ones that make you sit up and ask “why not?” and ones that make you wonder about the vary - ing contexts that produced such breathtakingly diverse renderings.</p>
<p>What is particularly striking (and what I believe propels Hindu nation - alists) is that so much of the mythological imagination that Modi and other Hindu nationalists narrate is now in fact the focus of the cutting edge of contemporary biosciences. Trees do communicate with each other, as do animals; the womb and fetus do not exist in isolation; reproduc tive technologies have expanded the possibilities of kinship; and indeed bodies are profoundly mutable. Hindu nationalists use these modern studies to bolster the veracity of mythological stories. Claiming a robust mytho - scientific corpus, they imagine a thoroughly modern, material, global, and scientific Hinduism. They do not rethink or reimagine science. Rather, they displace a “modern” science from the West and reclaim it within the borders and histories of ancient India, even while they claim the “cultural” modes of a Hinduism steeped in casteist, heterosexist, and patriarchal norms. Unlike other religious fundamentalisms, modern Hinduism has </p>
<p>produced not a scriptural fundamentalism but a political nationalism through a melding of science and religion. </p>
<p>Finally, one of the striking features of India is its syncretic pragmatism. While Hindu nationalism has grown in power and strength, religious fol - lowers still visit shrines of saints and gods across religious lines. Some </p>
<p>sites are famous for fertility, others for the health of the heart, others for wealth, others for warding off evil, and one even for successfully securing </p>
<p>a visa. While ostensibly practicing one religion, pragmatic individuals may acknowledge the powers of various religious sites. Similarly, we see deep pragmatism around health practices. With multiple practitioners of medi - cine, families routinely will visit doctors of allopa thy, homeopathy, Ayurveda, and Unani medical systems. These approaches are not seen as contradictory. In a land of multiple religions, time warps, and polytheism (Hinduism has 33 million gods, according to one count) (Dasa 2012), there </p>
<p>is no singular epistemology or ideology that limits that pragmatism. Mythological tales flow into scientific tales, the natural and supernatural mingle, and science and religion cohere into pragmatic living. </p>
<p>Science and religion are not oppositional. They are something else— tools, allies, synergies, partners, symbionts, challengers, colluders, or syncretic collaborators. The contours of modernity in India expose the polyvocal imbrications of science and religion. </p>
<p>As the five illustrative cases unfolded, what emerged repeatedly were the politics of crossings—of exchange, hybridity, and translation. The vibrant field of trans studies, with its treatments of crossing, shifting, traveling, pivoting, thwarting, has undoubtedly inspired my thinking. Because of the books’ focus on India, I was drawn to the figure of the avatar in Indian mythology, and its trans politics, as a potent epistemological tool to under - stand postcolonial formations of science and religion. </p>
<p>Avatars, a central concept within Hindu mythology, suggest the divine coming down into human and animal forms. The root of <em>trans-</em> shares a commonality with a Sanskrit root, <em>tara</em>, both meaning “cross.” <em>Avatara</em> has to do with the crossing of deities—their descent to Earth (Osuri 2011). In the famous mythological tales of Dasavatar, the stories depict the god Vishnu’s ten avatars. In these stories, problems caused by power - ful demigods leave the Earth in chaos, and Vishnu, embodying various </p>
<p>human/nonhuman forms, descends to Earth to bring peace again. In com - puter gaming today, avatars have come to represent online identities of individuals. At the heart of avatars is a disassembling of identity and form, and its subsequent assembling into another. Avatars are an expression of a general condition of entanglement and highlight the entanglement of the divine with earthly life. Even the word <em>tantra</em>, which I’ve always associ - ated with eroticism in the West, has a different valence in India (Dhamija 2000). The Sanskrit term translates to “weave, loom, and warp,” suggest - ing the interweaving of traditions and teachings as threads into a text, technique, or practice. The Hindu god Vishnu is called <em>tantuvardan</em> or “weaver” because he is said to have woven the rays of the sun into a garment for himself (M. Chatterjee 2000). Similarly, the concept of karma is a force that works across/trans individuals; every act is a karma of vari - ous people. </p>
<p>I use  <em>avatar</em> rather than <em>trans/national</em> because with its Indian reso - nance, it offers more—of translation, traversing, transmigration, transmu - tation, transnational, transmogrification. Within Indian storytelling practices, one doesn’t “cross” from one ontological entity to another. Rather, </p>
<p>souls, spirits, and ghosts can travel, cross, and return. They can also be in multiple places at once. Like the avatars of Hindu mythology, the vari - ous avatars of bionationalism in this book take different forms because </p>
<p>they are intervening in different problems to offer different solutions. However, the scientific world, like the <em>devalok</em>, where the gods reside, lives </p>
<p>on. Local avatars of bionationalism do not appear to challenge or trans - form the scientific or godly worlds. Mythology and avatars are also use-</p>
<p><code></code>ful because they resist the idea that everything is always translatable. As the case studies reveal, avatars can be unsuccessful, be partially success - ful, or spawn new problems. These spaces of ambivalence, contradictions, </p>
<p>and possibilities are important spaces that reveal the need for theories of “trans”/crossings.</p>
<p>Avatars and their trans politics also signal how modern bionational - ism traverses many borders into geographic, temporal, and disciplinary crossings. The transnational emerges as a critically important site for Hindu nationalism as an active and passionate diaspora spreads the reach of Hindu nationalism abroad. Indeed, “instead of encouraging a sense of world  citizenship,  the  transnational  experience  seems  to  reinforce </p>
<p>nationalist as well as religious identity” (van der Veer 1994: xii). A “long distance nationalism” (B. Anderson 1992) mobilizes and unifies a diasporic community on a “world mission” to propagate the Hindu notion of the world into a united and single global family (Andersen and Damle 2018).</p>
<p>Taken together, these five cases represent very particular and deliberate forms of bionationalism—where science and religion come together in specific formations in order to propel a particular vision of the nation. The stories do not represent the triumph of Hindu nationalism; indeed, secular nationalism is an important part of many of these stories. Rather, what they expose is how biopolitics has become a critical frame through which contemporary state and nonstate actors act. These are the new avatars of bionationalism, each avatar representing a site of heterogeneously imbri - cated formations of science and religion. These avatars are techno-religious objects. They are particular and peculiar formations—institutional and instrumental—in the quest for a modern global India. They thrive because of the confluence of particular historical, economic, cultural, political, and global contexts that cohere to shore up India as a “wounded civilization” and Hindu nationalism as its biopolitical power and savior. The goal is for India to have its rightful place in the global pantheon of superpowers.</p>
<p>As we see a growth in scholarship of feminist, postcolonial, trans - national, and indigenous STS, we have seen the rise of many salvation nar ratives for science and STS. Scholars have lamented that Western enlightenment has arrived at the winter of its discontent; others exhort the third world to eschew Western models and embrace its indigeneity. Yet a perusal of postcolonial STS and Indian nationalism suggests that knowledge claims do not automatically render progressive worlds. To enable progressive and liberatory worlds, we need progressive and liberatory politics that are attuned to the oppression and violence of our histories. India and other third-world nations may claim their own enlightenment, their own modernities. Similarly, the West may never have been modern (Latour 1993) and may have always lived in different registers of rationality (Chakrabarty 2000). Giving up these easy tropes of the West and the East, of modernity and nonmodernity, reveals the need for new narratives for planetary salvation (Meighoo 2016). To understand India is to also appreci - ate its many genealogies and its lush imaginations of the real and unreal, the rational and irrational, the natural and preternatural, of this world </p>

<p>and others, and learning to see, feel, hear, touch, listen, and mingle with fellow creatures in this world and others. To understand how India got from there to here requires us to embrace the phantasmagoric lives of science and religion. To embrace the many stolen dreams, fantastical narratives, storytelling traditions, and progressive possibilities that were appropriated over the long histories of colonialism and conquest, and over the violence committed in the name of caste, gender, sexuality, nation, science, and religion. We open ourselves to the possibility that in embracing such netherworlds—their dizzying spirits, their disavowal of the strictures of rationality, reason, and civilizational logic—we may dream and build new avatars to fulfill our forgotten dreams for more vital, vibrant, and just futures.</p>

<p>Uruvam extended its abundant tentacles across Kari. Its multisensory skin turned translucent as it sampled the environmental conditions. Waves of color roiled through its agile body as it absorbed the information. Once done, Uruvam retracted its tentacles into its body and transformed itself into a black octahedron. Uruvam was the node, or Kanu, of <em>form</em> for the experiment. It was capable of morphing itself into infinite shapes. The avatars joked that Uruvam, constantly transforming into intricate patterns and shapes, had a geometric soul. As it processed its newly absorbed infor - mation, Uruvam contemplated the landscapes on Kari, noting that the skies were a little less blue. There were more swirling clouds hovering over the planet than in the past. Uruvam morphed into a purple cuboid and reflected on the disappointing news. How much it had tried to get earth - lings to appreciate the joys of forms and morphologies that earthly biology made possible! How wondrous was a biology grounded in the cons tantly mutating and recombining biology of DNA on a planet whose environment was forever changing. The current iteration on Kari fascinated the Kan - kavars because of the surprising evolution of humans, who called them - selves <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Things were going well until certain groups of humans crowned themselves judge and jury of all life on Kari. They had developed new concepts like “beauty,” but rather than learning to appreciate the multiple forms of beauty everywhere, beauty became a singular and uni - versal concept, and <em>Homo sapiens</em> organized and rewarded those earthlings who followed a very narrow conception of form and beauty. </p>
<p>46</p>
<p>Uruvam was not happy. What irked it more than anything else, it said, was earthly mathematics. Why couldn’t they count past two? They’d dis - covered zero and infinity and everything in between, yet they could not </p>
<p>give up their love for thinking in dualisms. Uruvam had created and intro - duced so many bodily morphologies and inventive body parts—some criti - cal, others suspiciously useless—each of which displayed endless variation, </p>
<p>yet humans could not see it. With time, earthlings had discovered some variations. Some plants and animals embraced spectacularly intricate and outrageous morphologies. They preened, displayed, reveled in, and paraded their extravagant structures. The aberrant species was the human, which still had failed to grasp the rhythms of carbon-based evolution. </p>
<p>Uruvam had created groups with a multiplicity of religions and reli - gious icons—virgin birth, multiple heads, multiple hands, human-animal hybrid gods, human-plant gods. But <em>Homo sapiens</em> inevitably chronicled </p>
<p>that immense diversity into two groups—gods and goddesses, gods and demons, Devas and Asuras, humans and nonhumans, animals and plants. Only two. Two sexes, male and female; two genders, masculine and femi - nine; two sexualities, homosexual and heterosexual. They had invented other terms—race, caste, ability, culture, illness—and again, despite many options, <em>Homo sapiens</em> always reduced it to black and white, upper and </p>
<p>lower caste, able bodied and disabled, high and low culture, healthy and ill. It was always an “us” and “them.” And if you were unfortunate enough to be a “them,” you were relegated to a separate category, as the “other,” deemed inferior and not worthy of any respect or consideration. Uruvam introduced many technologies—body enhancement, genetic </p>
<p>engineering, body sculpting, sex change, sexual transformation, body morphing, chimeric development, gender enhancement, pansexuality machines, hybridization, skin grafting, organ development—but it seemed that whatever it introduced, the humans only used it to mold themselves into an increasingly narrow conception of beauty. How these oppressive humans had tortured and vilified those “other” creatures on Kari—like they were put on Kari to be served! Some <em>Homo sapiens</em> had noticed this </p>
<p>and been outraged by it; they pointed it out, had written about it, and indeed devoted whole academic fields to it. But the mathematics of “two” would not budge!  <em>Are all my wonderful imaginations are going to be ultimately reduced to this</em>, Uruvam sighed.</p>
<p>the story oF uruvam  47</p>
<p>Uruvam had planted the seeds of a plenitude of modes of life— decomposition, recycling, reincarnation, transmigration of souls, spirits, ghouls, zombies, and ghosts. Over time, Uruvam fretted that any group that believed in spirits or ghosts was quickly written off as “primitive” and sidelined as unscientific and unwise. Uruvam had anticipated even this and sowed the seeds for other theories. Some <em>Homo sapiens</em> had uncov -</p>
<p>ered clues to understand the natural cycles of carbon biologies—the decay - ing and decomposition, the possibilities of recycling and composting. But others, alas the majority, could still not see that all new beings were car - bon matter and must therefore come from the disintegration of old carbon beings. Why could humans not appreciate that the planet was organized around cyclicity, not linearity?</p>
<p>Uruvam remembered the many experiments. The duckbill platypus, when it was discovered, looked to the British like an animal with the bill of a duck attached to the skin of a mole. Uruvam was amused when the British wondered if Chinese sailors were playing a joke and had stitched this hybrid creature together. But these moments of skepticism never lasted. With time, all the anomalies and exceptions were neatly explained away. With the need for singular theories, humans used criteria like parsi - mony and elegance to weed out inconvenient complexity. Ultimately, all of Uruvam’s wondrous, playful, and creative experiments were neutralized by biological and scientific theories. Uruvam had descended as several famous scientific avatars. These avatars espoused a humanism to counteract the increasing dehumanization of scientific thought. They espoused the maj- esty and beauty of the planet and its life forms, the infinite universe, and the enchantment of the wondrous world around. While the avatars were initially hailed as visionaries, the enchantment, humility, and sense of wonder was eventually forgotten, and the disillusioned souls floated back to Avatara Lokam. They and their visions were once again replaced by a singular certainty and objectivity. Diversity of thought, like diversity of form, Uruvam lamented, was always contained by the dictates of theory. </p>
<p>The final stages of Uruvam’s plans were unfolding. Uruvam started working with Amudha, and together wondrous morphologies were unfold - ing on Kari. Would wonder and beauty return to Kari?</p>

For the first time in Indian history, Modi’s party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata* Party (BJP), won a landslide election with enough votes (292 seats out of 543) to form a government, while the opposition, the Congress Party, was reduced to a historic low, winning only 44 seats. The victory of the BJP is seen widely as the victory and success of Narendra Modi, former chief minister of the state of Gujarat (<em>Economist</em> 2014).
