<p><strong>3 Econationalisms</strong></p>
<p>First Nations in the Plutonium Economy</p>
<p>After the Second World War, Oppenheimer‚Äôs slogan concerning Los Alamos was ‚ÄúLet us give it back to the Indians.‚Äù To his great credit Norris Bradbury, as the first postwar director of Los Alamos, prevented that from happening.</p>
<p>‚ÄîEdward Teller, ‚ÄúThe Laboratory of the Atomic Age‚Äù</p>
<p>The most important truth about Los Alamos National Laboratory is that it has always been and still is a secret; a center whose work has always been kept utterly shrouded from the view of the world; a place with no public memory.</p>
<p>‚ÄîHerman Agoyo (San Juan Pueblo), ‚ÄúWho Here Will Begin This Story?‚Äù</p>
<p>When the Manhattan Project arrived on the Pajarito Plateau in 1943 it was to be a temporary U.S. intrusion into northern New Mexico, a nec- essary military undertaking that would disappear after the end of the war. Few suspected at the time that the launch of the military atomic age, and then the Cold War, would lead to a permanent technoscientific pres- ence on the plateau, one that would make the plutonium economy a per- petual feature of life along the northern Rio Grande. For those pursuing military nuclear science, the future has always offered an unending pos- sibility for self-reinvention, as each new technological advance partici- pates in a modernist notion of progress that displaces the past in favor of the future. Edward Teller offers us a perfect illustration of this logic‚Äî and its hidden cost‚Äîin his contribution to an anniversary edition of <em>Los Alamos Science</em> in 1993. Teller celebrates the fiftieth year of Los Alamos by forecasting a bright post‚ÄìCold War future for the laboratory, involv- ing ‚Äúan open minded pursuit of the truly limitless possibilities presented to inquiring minds by scientific and technological revolutions‚Äù (1993: 37). But in so doing, he also acknowledges a national-cultural rupture, a spatial displacement enabling the U.S. progression into the nuclear age. For Teller, the centrality of Los Alamos in the realm of military nuclear</p>

<p>science supplants all other claims to the Pajarito Plateau. He evokes an indigenous presence simply as counterexample, as a dramatic means of underscoring the ongoing achievement of the Manhattan Project, involv- ing the transformation of a preindustrial space into a cutting-edge labo- ratory capable of unending technoscientific revolution. Teller‚Äôs history of Los Alamos thus mirrors the history of the United States, as the logics of discovery‚Äîof both continents and isotopes‚Äîrely on simultaneous acts of colonialism, forgetting, and reinvention (cf. Carter 1988).</p>
<p>The doubled nature of this history is a visceral reality for those who have inhabited the northern Rio Grande valley ‚Äúfrom time immemorial.‚Äù For indigenous communities, the Manhattan Project is not usually located within a narrative of technoscientific progress or Cold War strategy or American military power, but in more exclusively local terms. The atomic bomb project figures as the source of important new jobs and cross-cul- tural contacts for Pueblo peoples, but also of profound rupture. Marking the fiftieth anniversary of the Manhattan Project from a different vantage point, Herman Agoyo (San Juan) engages these multiple registers of Pueblo experience, placing U.S. practices of secrecy and amnesia at the center of a process that has produced profound historical change along the northern Rio Grande.1 In 1993, at the first public meeting between offi- cials from Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the U.S. Depart- ment of Energy (DOE) and northern New Mexican community leaders, Agoyo takes advantage of the immediate post‚ÄìCold War moment to give voice to longstanding regional concerns. He begins his presentation by asking, ‚Äúwhat should I tell my grandson‚Äù about Los Alamos? Agoyo‚Äôs his- tory of the Manhattan Project is, then, immediately grounded not in technoscientific achievement but in interpersonal relationships and gener- ational reproduction. Acknowledging that when the Manhattan Project first arrived on the Pajarito Plateau many at the Pueblo thought it was going to be a ‚Äúblessing,‚Äù one that ensured jobs, education, and security, Agoyo concludes that Los Alamos‚Äôs fifty-year legacy is one of ‚Äúashes‚Äù:</p>
<p>We have slowly realized that this work which started out to harness an unimaginable power has in fact harmed human beings and the planet beyond any calculation. It has harmed us all by the sickness, death, and destruction that has been the ultimate product of this work. It has harmed us by the nightmare fear instilled in the hearts and minds of all the world‚Äôs peoples about nuclear war and radiation ‚Äúaccidents.‚Äù It has violated and harmed us by the awful problems of pollution and defilement caused in han- dling and disposing of the radioactive materials dumped onto and into Mother Earth. (1995: 37)</p>
<p><em>It has violated and harmed us.</em> Agoyo‚Äôs initial description of Los Alamos as a ‚Äúplace with no public memory‚Äù shifts the terms of the Manhattan Project</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>from a concern with military technoscience to local accountability, and from a global vision of American power to a regional assessment of the ecological and social impacts of that nuclear vision. What for Teller is a story of modernist progress, becomes for Agoyo an ongoing experience of radioactive coloniza- tion provoking a unique experience of the nuclear uncanny. Tribal rights, the politics of nuclear waste and war, as well as the possibility of extinction are linked processes in Agoyo‚Äôs call to public memory, as the Manhattan Project is identified not as a source of global security, but rather of local defilement, pol- lution, and cultural disorientation.</p>
<p>If Teller ultimately argues that we forget the past to enable the future, Agoyo reminds us that the ‚Äúpast‚Äù is not so easily displaced, that LANL occupies a territorial space that remains vibrant within older, and substan- tially different, cosmological orders. This chapter explores northeastern Pueblo perspectives on the Manhattan Project, forwarding the realization that Los Alamos occupied a space richly animated within preexisting uni- verses, intimate worlds now tied not only to modernist powers of self-rein- vention but also energized by cyclic relations with nature. The U.S. nuclear project, from this perspective, is a new moment in the colonial history of the Southwest, as ecosystems, bodies, and cosmologies have been transformed by their biological, social, and spiritual engagement with the plutonium economy. For the Manhattan Project not only produced the bomb, it initi- ated an ongoing transformation of specific Pueblo universes. Agoyo‚Äôs call to public memory thus engages not only the question of national sacrifice and citizenship, but also begins to chart a fundamentally different history of the nuclear age. From his perspective, the challenge of the nuclear age for indigenous communities involves balancing the local opportunities and haz- ards of U.S. military-industrial production, while maintaining the viability of political formations that predate the American, Mexican, and Spanish regimes. Put differently, the first international context the Manhattan Pro- ject engaged in 1943‚Äîbut the very last to be recognized in 1993‚Äîinvolves the Pueblo communities that live at the foot of the Pajarito Plateau, who venerate the land now occupied by the laboratory as ancestral ground, and who are negotiating the biosocial effects of U.S. nuclear weapons science.</p>
<p>ECOLOGIES OF PLACE</p>
<p>The Pueblos all set careful limits to the boundaries of their world and order everything within it. These boundaries are not the same but, more impor- tant, the principles of setting boundaries are since all use phenomena in the four cardinal directions, either mountains or bodies of water, usually both</p>

<p>While Manhattan Project scientists began work in secret to produce security on a global scale in 1943, they unknowingly colonized a space that was already intricately involved in producing knowledge and secu- rity on uniquely local terms. U.S. military technoscience entered into a geographic space that was central to multiple Pueblo cultures, and that participated in a specific technology for producing security in everyday life. These indigenous technologies, as we shall see, were and are grounded in logics of ecological management and are protected by long- standing traditions of secrecy. Since 1943, dueling cultures of secrecy have worked on the Pajarito Plateau to mobilize nature for the benefits of their societies: as physicists worked to unlock the power of the atom in laboratories and test sites, Pueblo leaders sought to manage the eco- logical balance in their universe through the ritual maintenance of a complex system of shrines and sacred sites. The precision of nuclear weapons science collides here with the precision of Pueblo place making, which, as Alfonso Ortiz has argued, is a uniquely powerful aspect of northeastern Pueblo cosmology. The untold story of the Manhattan Pro- ject involves this collision between regimes of knowledge, concepts of nature, definitions of security, and secrecy societies on the Pajarito Plateau. In this section, I engage the basic structures of northeastern Pueblo cosmology to underscore the cultural and ecological effects of the arrival of the Manhattan Project in 1943. I forward the work of Pueblo intellectuals writing about their own traditions, noting that much of this knowledge remains protected within Pueblo societies. Indeed, as we shall see, for good reason it is often easier for an outsider to talk to a weapons scientist about the bomb at Los Alamos than to Pueblo leaders about their specific cultural investments in the land now occupied by LANL.</p>
<p>For the northeastern Pueblo nations, mythohistory begins with an emergence from inside the earth, a moment when‚Äînot unlike a plant seedling‚Äîeach of the tribes left a dark underworld, and with the help of supernatural and animal guides, pushed up toward the daylight to inhabit the surface of the earth.2 Each of the northeastern Pueblos has its own tale of emergence, which in general terms, relates how the tribe traveled on a difficult journey (for the Tewa, from underneath a lake; for the Keres, from a cave known as Shipapu), discovering witchcraft and death for the first time, but also the fertile river valley surrounded by the</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>four sacred mountains where they now live. For the Tewa, the guardian spirits that accompanied the tribe from the underworld went directly to the four cardinal mountaintops to look after the people, and those that died on this first journey were buried near the Pueblo, returned to the earth where their spirits could be forever spoken to and taken care of (A. Ortiz 1969). The emergence stories tie the people in a unique man- ner to the earth, establishing their identity not simply within a specific geographical space, but also through maintaining an intimate, tactile engagement with a spiritually animated place. Some of the stories, for example, describe how the earth‚Äôs surface was soft at the moment of emergence, leaving behind the footprints of the first people; marks that remain visible today in hardened rock and, through their continued vis- ceral presence, provide a spatial mnemonic of that first journey. Simi- larly, the emergence stories describe how the people were directly involved in creating the divisions between summer and winter, male and female, as well as articulating the six cardinal directions and energizing specific relationships between all sentient beings, which include not only humans and supernatural spirits, but also animals, insects, rocks, plants and trees, rivers and springs, weather systems, and clouds. In this way, the emergence tales define an ecological universe and make the tribe inti- mately responsible for encouraging life and harmony between all the beings that populate the three levels of existence that make up that universe‚Äîthe underworld, the surface of the earth, and the sky.</p>
<p>As a complicated philosophical system that locates humans as merely one element in a broader ecology, Pueblo cosmologies argue that the people are inseparable from the specific geographical space in which they now live, a place where their ancestors are buried and where the chan- nels of power connecting the different levels of existence line up to focus life energy on their communities (A. Ortiz 1969: 141). The northern Rio Grande valley, thus, offers up sensual traces of the initial moment of world making through specific landmarks that remain part of everyday life and that, through mythohistory, emphasize the essential consanguin- ity of all aspects of nature. As Rina Swentzell (Santa Clara) describes it, for the Tewa:</p>
<p>differences among the elements of the life force (or nature) are recognized and accepted, but essential characteristics are known to be the same. For instance, a lump of clay is recognized to be akin to the human holding it because the force which determines the essence of clay is identical to that which deter- mines human beings. The Tewa word ‚Äúnung‚Äù is translated to mean ‚Äúus‚Äù or ‚Äúclay‚Äù depending on the context. There is direct cross-communication possi- ble between all elements of nature‚Äîhuman, plants, other animals, and even natural phenomena. (1982: 17; see also Naranjo 1992)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The essence of clay is identical to that which determines  human beings.</em> The intimacy of this universe is underscored by the emotional attributes given to all aspects of the natural world, which historically required people with the right heart to soothe powerful beings that can be lonely or vengeful as well as generous and caring (Parsons 1996: 198; also Laski 1958: 78).3 A successful mediation of all these seen and unseen forces, enabled by the right mental attitude toward nature, produces a healthy ecospiritual system, which provides ample nourishment for all beings.4</p>
<p>Pueblo emergence stories articulate the fundamental coordinates of traditional Pueblo thought, defining specific cosmologies centered on maintaining intimate relations with all the beings that live within a fixed geographical space visibly bounded by the four cardinal mountains (see Hewett and Dutton 1945: 34‚Äì44). Alfonso Ortiz argues that the funda- mental difference between Euro-American and Pueblo cosmologies is that Pueblo peoples emphasize an experience of space over time.5 This is a profoundly different way of organizing both tactile experience and social history. Whereas a European metaphysics privileges a movement through linear time (in which each moment is unique and nonrepeat- able), northeastern Pueblo cosmologies emphasize a spatiotemporal rep- etition based on a cyclical movement through a specific physical space (historically tied to the agricultural cycle). Within northeastern Pueblo cosmologies the past remains both fixed and animated within the land- scape itself, allowing ongoing interactions with the first supernaturals as well as the entire ancestral lineage of the tribe and the ecosystem. Since the intent of this system is the stability of a specific moment of harmony in the system, radical historical change presents a special challenge to Pueblo thought. Ortiz has argued that northeastern Pueblo oral tradi- tions endeavor to turn time into space by framing historical events in ways that reiterate the principles of the founding mythospatial charters.6 He notes, for example, that ritual clowns burlesque and caricature those who have intruded on Pueblo life‚ÄîSpanish explorers, missionaries, gov- ernment agents, and anthropologists‚Äîand thereby incorporate these for- eign elements into the ritual order, and through yearly repetition on the dance plaza, contain them within the Pueblo universe.7 In a discussion of how Pueblo communities first negotiated requests that they perform their dances outside of the specific dance plaza where they are seasonally per- formed, Ortiz provides further insight into these spatiotemporal logics:</p>
<p>Not only were their own traditional sacred dances rigidly locked into the seasonal cycle, but they could not be performed outside of a given sacred space within a Pueblo because it was believed that the dance would not only lose all its efficacy, but that it would have no meaning whatsoever outside of that sacred space. The reason they believed so is that a ceremonial</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>occasion is viewed metaphorically as being like a plant. When the date for the ceremony is set, it is believed that a crack appears in the earth where the seed of the dance has sprouted. The song-composing and practice sessions in preparation for the dance are viewed as being analogous to the states of growth of the plant. The day of the dance itself is considered the day when the plant bears fruit. Hence, through these powerful earth-bound metaphors the Pueblo peoples reinforced their sense of, and commitment to, the particular places they inhabit. They found it difficult to even think of these locale-centered ceremonies as having any meaning apart  from  the earth which gave them their being. (1977: 18)</p>
<p>Power, place, and identity are thus woven together in these traditions to promote a specific ecosocial order.</p>
<p>The overall effect of this philosophical system, in each of its manifes- tations along the Rio Grande, is to delineate clearly the borders of the Pueblo world and to focus Pueblo attention inward onto  the  village space. Historically, for example, the Tewa believed that the farther one traveled from the village center the more dangerous the world became, requiring ritual prohibitions on those that traveled into the mountains where the most powerful deities live (A. Ortiz 1969: 129; see also 1972: 157). Lakes, springs, and caves are sacred sites because they offer points of connection to the underworld; similarly, an  elaborate  system  of shrines presents a symbolic means of channeling life energy or ‚Äúhealing‚Äù power onto the Pueblo (Naranjo and Swentzell 1989). At the top of the four cardinal mountains that orient northeastern Pueblo  thought  are sacred lakes where the supernaturals that led the tribe out of the under- world live, as well as <em>nan sipu</em>, or earth navels, where the ancestors live and watch over the Pueblo (A. Ortiz 1969: 19).8 For the Tewa of San Juan, the hills between the sacred mountains and the village also have earth navels as well as caves or tunnels where specific  supernatural beings live who visit the Pueblo during ceremonies in the form of masked dancers. At the very center of the village is the <em>sipapu</em>, the mythohistor- ical place of emergence, where all the directions come together (the car- dinal points as well as the underworld and the sky). Energy flows out from the sipapu toward the mountain earth navels, which then return that energy toward the village, and in this constant flow of  energy between sites, blessings are distributed over the entire Pueblo geospiri- tual system. The shrine system not only integrates Pueblo members into the local ecology, it is a technological means of producing security in their world.</p>
<p>Pueblo people know, then, exactly where the center of the universe is and work through yearly ritual cycles to channel the energy of that site for the benefit of the entire ecosystem. In the late winter, for example, the religious leaders at San Juan place seeds from all the village crops deep</p>

<p>into the sipapu in the dead of night, and through this act, reach down into the underworld and wake up nature from its winter slumber, enabling Spring itself to begin (A. Ortiz 1969: 21, 114). The intercon- nectedness of this system makes life precarious, in that parts can influ- ence the whole‚Äîthat is, individual beings can affect the entire ecosystem (A. Ortiz 1972: 143). Northeastern Pueblo cosmologies ultimately rely on all sentient beings to participate productively in the flow of life, which requires that each being maintain a harmony of thought and action to produce a healthy ecology (Laski 1958). The philosophical beauty in these cosmologies is drawn from the way in which space, ecology, power, and action are consciously interconnected, placing humans within the center of an animate universe that requires the concerted action of all beings to continue life. Northeastern Pueblo cosmologies thus present a view of a rigorously ordered universe in which all beings have a specific role to play. Or, as Alfonso Ortiz once concluded, paraphrasing Albert Einstein, the physicist who helped launch the Manhattan Project, ‚Äúthe gods do not play dice with our universe‚Äù (1976: 38).</p>
<p>The seeming fragility of this cultural system is countered by the his- torical reality that northeastern Pueblo peoples have lived in the same territory, tended the same shrines, and successfully reproduced the natu- ral order for over a millennium. With its fences and U.S. national secu- rity science, the Manhattan Project, however, introduced a rupture into this system, fundamentally altering how the shrine system could be engaged in everyday life. One Tewa resident of the valley described the technoscientific transformation of the Pajarito Plateau to me this way:</p>
<p>The Forest Service had already taken all the land, so it made it easy for the government to transfer land from one organization to another. That‚Äôs when the Pueblos lost a lot of their land. We lost an area that we used for ceremo- nial purposes. We‚Äôve now got the right to go up there but we don‚Äôt own it anymore. The mountain there was used for ceremonial purposes‚Äîfor pil- grimages to shrines and other things. I remember my uncle going up to a site and crying because they had put in pipes that ruined the area. Once the build- ings go in the religious character of the site is ruined. The MESON physics facility rests on a number of archaeological sites, as does Area G. They also do archaeological excavations up there. All of these are acts of desecration and none of the laws work to protect our interests. It‚Äôs always the anthro- pologists, archaeologists, and engineers that have the legal advantage.</p>
<p><em>Once the buildings go in the religious  character  of  the  site  is ruined.</em> As a counterhistory of the Manhattan Project, this narrative moves from territorial colonization to religious and environmental dese- cration to interpersonal loss. It marks a collision in ecological and national regimes, and describes a cultural space transformed by military nuclear</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>science. Whereas Pueblo cosmology emphasizes human participation in a broader ecosystem and reciprocal relations with nature, modernist techno- science at LANL assumes a position outside of nature, allowing a careful observation and manipulation of the basic building blocks of the universe (in which humans are not directly implicated in a system of reciprocal obli- gation). The collision between modernist technoscience and Pueblo ecology on the plateau is now a multigenerational process. A Tewa spokesman described his feelings about LANL to me this way: ‚ÄúThings have gotten bet- ter since the fences came down in the ‚Äò50s, but it‚Äôs like we had a shot-gun marriage 52 years ago that has not yet been consummated. We‚Äôve lived side by side for 52 years and are just now learning to say hello to one another. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that everything is good, or that war is still not possible.‚Äù</p>
<p>Because the U.S. atomic bomb project occupied the top of one of the most prominent mountain ranges in the northern Rio Grande valley, it necessarily affected all those communities for whom mountains are sources of power. Los Alamos, in fact, occupies a place of particular importance within northeastern Pueblo thought‚Äîat the  foot  of  the Valles Caldera Volcano, one of the largest in the Jemez Mountain Range. Greg Cajete (Santa Clara), while serving on the Santa Clara Tribal Coun- cil, discussed the implications of locating the laboratory at the foot of the volcano in his comments to the LANL 2000 conference in 1993:</p>
<p>The lab itself is located in what we consider one of the most sacred areas among the northern Pueblos, located in a place of fire, it is right at the foot of a volcano. There is always reflection on exactly why the lab is there, because we as Pueblo peoples believe that nothing happens by accident, that situations evolve because in many ways they were meant to. So here you have basically an entity dealing with the very deepest secrets of nature which is, in a sense, releasing the eternal fire, which is the energy that is such an essential part of the life of the cosmos itself, and it being surrounded by some very, very sacred sites.</p>
<p><em>Nothing happens by accident.</em> Here, the location of the U.S. nuclear project takes on specific meaning within the Pueblo universe, raising questions about the implications of weapons science within a specific georeligious topography. The Pajarito Plateau is that section of the east- ern slope of Jemez Mountain Range that is located in a thirty-mile stretch between Santa Clara Pueblo and Cochiti Pueblo; it is visible from most of the northern Pueblos. It is one of the oldest inhabited areas in the Southwest, with signs of human occupation going back nearly ten thousand years. Today, thousands of archaeological and religious sites on the plateau are manifestations of both the millennial human</p>

<p>investments in the region and the ongoing traditional use by indigenous peoples throughout the Southwest. Indeed, the Jemez Mountains remain an important cultural site not only for the Rio Grande Pueblos‚Äîwhich recognize them as a fundamental aspect of their geospiritual order‚Äîbut also for the Acoma, Zuni, Hopi, Navajo, Mescalaro Apache, and Jicar- illa Apache nations. Indigenous communities throughout the Southwest collect spring water, medicinal plants, minerals, and clay on the Jemez Range, and identify the plateau as a spiritually important site. The Pajarito Plateau participates in a complex universe of symbolic sites, including ruins, shrines, powerful natural elements (springs, caves, and lakes), as well as sites of mythohistorical emergence.9</p>
<p>The Manhattan Project landed within this multiply invested geospiri- tual space in 1943, eventually occupying 43 square miles on the Pajarito Plateau with some 150 miles of roads, 1,000 buildings, 400 miles of waste pipes (including 8 miles of radioactive waste lines), 123 liquid effluent discharge points, and 94 air emission sources. To this one needs to add the physical impact of the Los Alamos town site which, like the laboratory, has long since given up claims on being merely a temporary presence on the plateau, now maintaining a population of over 17,000. Thus, while northeastern Pueblo nations have experienced a rapid change in their own political and religious orders in the past fifty years, the Pajarito Plateau has been remade by the Manhattan Project into a major industrial site, transforming one-quarter of the northeastern Pueb- los‚Äô symbolic universe into an experimental nuclear laboratory. Indeed, a curious feature of Pueblo country is that, with the exception of the Hopi and Zuni nations, all sixteen eastern Pueblo territories are located within the immediate orbit of a U.S. nuclear facility (either LANL or Sandia, in Albuquerque; see Figure 3.1). The Manhattan Project thus unleashed a physical assault on Pueblo geospiritual orders, denying tribal members access to certain sites while destroying others. Moreover, the indigenous nations that live downwind and downstream from the laboratory must now assess the ecological and health impacts of the atomic bomb project on their communities. Having survived Spanish and Mexican territorial governments, U.S. colonization, and the Cold War, Pueblo leaders are now asking what happens when the Manhattan Project finally ends, when, in perhaps a far distant future, the laboratory finally closes down and the cumulative ecological and spiritual legacies of U.S. nuclear sci- ence return to a uniquely Pueblo provenance.</p>
<p>A profound cosmological divide separates northeastern Pueblo con- cepts of nature from the new residents on the plateau. Part of the sacred- ness of mountains, lakes, springs, and caves for Pueblo peoples is their very wildness, their undisturbed nature, which participates in and</p>

As Euro-American cultures empha¬≠ size the built over the natural, there is an enormous problem of transla¬≠ tion for Pueblo communities who need to make the case that a specific area, devoid of any development or recreational use, is not merely of aes¬≠ thetic value, but is profoundly powerful and necessary in a spiritual sense (see Naranjo and Swentzell 1989: 260-61).

<p>make this point by arguing that commercial development in some natu- ral areas is the cultural equivalent of building a golf course, ski lodge, uranium mine, or nuclear weapons laboratory on top of Notre Dame Cathedral or Westminster Abby. Governor Walter Dasheno of  Santa Clara Pueblo put it this way:</p>
<p>The environment is an interaction of many forces, a unity of all things. There are the physical and there are the spiritual. And, I don‚Äôt believe we can or should separate them. We have taken, as a major environmental theme, protection of our religious and cultural resources. We argue strenu- ously that equal consideration should be given to our religious concerns including practices that do not violate our sacred areas as a principle in environmental protection. This concept is difficult for governmental bureaucrats, business people and many other non-Indians to understand. We have suggested, however, that if a project were proposed underneath the National Cathedral or in Arlington National Cemetery, there would be a collective cry from all segments of our society. I submit that standards of respect and deference should be accorded the American Indian. When Los Alamos National Laboratories, for example, proposes to set off explosions on sacred ground, or to dump high level nuclear waste in sacred areas, the affront to our culture and religion is complete. We should not be required to specify in measurable terms why a sacred area is sacred. We should not have to fight for a law that segregates national protection of our religious beliefs from the same rights accorded other religious beliefs in America as outlined in our Constitution and Bill of Rights. We should not have to defend our cultural practices or sites in an environmental review process that is not required of any other American religion. (Quoted in South West Organizing Project 1993: 9)</p>
<p><em>We should not be required to specify in measurable terms why a sacred area  is  sacred.</em>  Governor  Dasheno‚Äôs  statement  underscores  that Pueblo concepts of land and place inform uniquely Pueblo universes, and are largely irreconcilable with the Protestant notion of private property or the value of ‚Äúimproving‚Äù the land through commercial development or technoscience. Put somewhat differently, while Judeo-Christian tradi- tions allow for an infinite production of sacred space through the conse- cration of built space, indigenous cosmologies ground the sacred within a natural ecology that is ultimately both fragile and irreproducible‚Äîonce a lake, or spring, or shrine is destroyed it cannot be replaced. Thus, the arrival of the Manhattan Project on  the  Pajarito  Plateau  not  only brought radically different concepts of nature, ecology, and power into collision, but also threatened (in just the act of building roads, facilities, and homes) indigenous connections to specific spiritually  animated places.</p>
<p>Private property law (a radical change from previous regimes along the northern Rio Grande), as well as the enormous immigration into</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>northern New Mexico after World War II, impacted  water  and  land rights as well as access to religious sites throughout the northern Rio Grande valley. The Jemez nation, for example, has a shrine on the top of Redondo Peak, which is now in private ownership. Joe Sando (Jemez) reports that the Pueblo now ‚Äúowns‚Äù a four feet by four feet section of the mountaintop where the shrine is located, but  still  must  get permission to visit the site for ceremonial purposes (1982: 11). Similarly, Geronima Cruz Montoya (San Juan) has publicly commented on the dif- ficulty San Juan religious leaders now have in completing their yearly pilgrimage to the top of Tsikumu P‚Äôin, a peak located just to the north of Los Alamos:</p>
<p>Just recently‚Äîsay in the last year or so‚Äîour people went on their annual pilgrimage and were shot at, so they really ran for cover in a hurry. Another time they asked ahead of time for clearance, so what did they find? White men waiting with cameras. Our people, of course, turned back disgustedly and disappointed and couldn‚Äôt go to the top for their rituals. Now I under- stand, the shrine is full of beer cans and other trash. Desecration of such sacred places has inflicted deeper wounds on the Indian people than some of the worst political injustices. For the disappearance of such sanctuaries has left a vacuum which nothing the white man has to offer will fill. (Shutes and Mellick 1996: 142; see also Ford 1992)</p>
<p>The destruction or pollution of a shrine or natural resource (e.g., a lake, spring, or cave) is damaging to the entire system, as the power of these sites is drawn from the cumulative energy produced by generations of care given to those areas and the reciprocal relations with the supernat- ural entities and ancestors that inhabit them. Traditionally, the discovery of garbage within an earth navel was attributed to malevolent spirits or witchcraft, and was believed to influence directly the stability of the entire ecosystem (Curtis 1970: 12). Today, in addition to the problem of land ownership and the term of U.S. nuclear science, some New Age reli- gious traditions have appropriated indigenous religious sites for their own use, leaving behind objects (candles, crystals, incense) that, for Pueblo peoples, pollute the shrine, and prevent it from being a conduit between entities and levels of existence. The conflict over who has the right to access and to use Pueblo religious sites is now a perennial prob- lem in northern New Mexico, due to the expansion of mountaintop developments (for roads, ski areas, and homes, as well as projects of the national laboratory). Thus, in the nuclear age, it has become increasingly impossible for Pueblo nations to focus their energies inward (as they his- torically have done except in times of crisis), as relations with LANL have become an increasingly complex means of ensuring Pueblo cultural survival.</p>

<p>THE NEW WORLD: 1942/1992</p>
<p>In August 1993 at the first public meeting to discuss the historical impacts and future of LANL, local Pueblo and Nuevomexicano activists hung a huge banner behind the LANL 2000 conference stage that read:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe Italian Navigator has landed in the New World.‚Äù ‚ÄúHow did he find the natives?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúVery friendly.‚Äù‚ÄîManhattan Project, December 2, 1942: Dialogue between Enrico Fermi‚Äôs laboratory in Chicago and Harvard University to announce the first self-sustaining fission chain reaction.</p>
<p>This quotation is from a coded exchange in the early days of the Manhattan Project between physicists Arthur Compton and  James Conant, who immediately understood the achievement of nuclear fission in Chicago to be on par with Christopher Columbus‚Äôs ‚Äúdiscovery‚Äù of the New World in 1492. Here, indigenous activists capitalize on a remark- able scene in 1942, in which physicist Enrico Fermi is seen to be chan- neling the spirit of the ‚ÄúItalian Navigator‚Äù under Stag Field in Chicago as he enters the subatomic realm of neutrinos for the first time, an Edenic New World where the locals were, like Columbus‚Äôs first contacts, always ‚Äúfriendly.‚Äù The play of words involved in this wartime transmission of nuclear secrets between scientific elites illustrates in a remarkably concise gesture the convergence between the colonial imaginary of the western frontier and that which would come to inform the nuclear frontier. By forwarding the racial politics embedded within this founding moment of the Manhattan Project, indigenous activists in northern New Mexico sought quietly to derail the seamless authority of Los Alamos National Laboratory as a ‚ÄúU.S. national security‚Äù institution. Pueblo and Nuevomexicano representatives took advantage of the post‚ÄìCold War moment to shift the ideological terrain away from a Cold War logic prioritizing ‚Äúnational‚Äù security, in order to ask more fundamental ques- tions about who is a citizen in the United States, and what kind of local sacrifices can be demanded of those living next to a nuclear weapons facility. In doing so, they also sought to put the laboratory on notice that the ‚Äúnatives‚Äù might not be ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù much longer.</p>
<p>Pueblo nations have always held a distinct place within U.S. law and history. As the oldest and most territorially rooted communities in the United States, they have maintained cultural integrity through three national regimes‚Äîthe Spanish, Mexican, and American. But despite a mil- lennium of residence along the northern Rio Grande River, Pueblo peoples have not always fallen into the category of the ‚ÄúNative American‚Äù within official U.S. discourse. Pueblo communities were incorporated into the</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>United States in 1848 with the conclusion of the war with Mexico. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo technically made all citizens of Mexico in the conquered territories into citizens of the United States. Pueblo peoples first entered the United States, then, not as indigenous communities but as Mexican citizens, and theoretically became full U.S. citizens at that moment. However, the legal status of Pueblo communities was debated from 1848 to 1913‚Äîa period in which they were neither U.S. citizens nor officially recognized as ‚ÄúNative American.‚Äù In <em>United States v. Lucero</em> (1869), the first legal case to address the question of whether Pueblo peo- ples were ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù under U.S. law, the court concluded that their ‚ÄúPueblo- ness‚Äù conflicted with their ‚ÄúIndian-ness‚Äù:</p>
<p>A law made for wild, wandering savages, to be extended over a people liv- ing for three centuries in fenced adobes and cultivating the soil for the maintenance of themselves and families and giving an example of virtue, honesty, and industry to their more civilized neighbors, in this enlightened age of progress and proper understanding of the civil rights of man, is con- sidered by this court as wholly inapplicable to the pueblo Indians of New Mexico. (Quoted in F. Cohen 1986: 387)</p>
<p>Too ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù to be ‚ÄúIndians,‚Äù while too ‚Äúsavage‚Äù to be truly ‚ÄúAmerican,‚Äù Pueblo communities exceeded the legal categories for identity in the nine- teenth century, and were left in a state of legal limbo until 1913, when Pueblo nations were officially granted ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù status (cf. Pearce 1965). At that moment, they became ‚Äúwards‚Äù of the federal government, gain- ing some legal protection and a limited recognition of their right to self- rule, but also giving up their claim to U.S. citizenship based on the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (see F. Cohen 1986: 385‚Äì88). Dur- ing this period, Pueblo governments negotiated constant threats to their land base, and in the first decades of the twentieth century, direct legal attacks on Pueblo religion by those who considered Indian religious practices to be ‚Äúanti-Christian‚Äù and ‚Äúun-American‚Äù (Sando 1992: 90‚Äì96). The U.S. Congress granted full U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans in 1924. However, Pueblo communities in New Mexico were denied that most basic right of citizenship, the right to vote, until 1948, a full century after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo promised full citi- zenship, and five years after the start of the Manhattan Project in New Mexico.</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, it should not be so surprising to learn that the word that best characterizes the official relationship between LANL and adjacent Pueblo nations during the Cold War is <em>silence</em>. As the Soviet Union began to come apart, however, Pueblo leaders began to hear from Santa Fe‚Äìbased activist groups of significant environmental problems at LANL, and began mobilizing for an accounting of the environmental</p>

<p>and health impacts on their communities. San Ildefonso Pueblo, which shares a territorial boundary with the laboratory and claims the Pajarito Plateau as ancestral land, initiated conversations with LANL to address tribal concerns about radiological impacts on Pueblo lands. The result- ing investigations of soil, water, air, specific ceremonial plants, and elk populations by LANL scientists concluded that there was ‚Äúno health risk‚Äù to San Ildefonso residents posed by laboratory activities. These results, however, were almost immediately contested by studies con- ducted by the Eight Northern Pueblos Office of Environmental Protec- tion, which showed ‚Äúalarmingly high levels of radiation‚Äù on tribal lands. In October 1992, San Ildefonso challenged the veracity of LANL reports by cordoning off a section of its territory that borders the laboratory with a sign declaring: ‚ÄúProlonged exposure to this area and gathering materials may be harmful to your health.‚Äù10 A few weeks later, a coali- tion of Pueblo, Nuevomexicano, and Anglo activists made a trip to Oakland, California, to confront the University of California board of regents, which has managed Los Alamos and Livermore National Laboratories since their inception. This New Mexican coalition pointed out that in the fifty-year history of Los Alamos, no UC representative had ever met with community groups in New Mexico to discuss labora- tory issues. Herman Agoyo (San Juan) declared the people of the north- ern Rio Grande valley ‚Äúthe forgotten public‚Äù; Gilbert Sanchez, the lieutenant governor of San Ildefonso, stated that ‚Äúlocal people have not been told what is going on‚Äù at Los Alamos; while Governor Walter Dasheno of Santa Clara wrote to the  UC  regents,  declaring  that ‚ÄúNew Mexico is not a scientific colony to the State of California.‚Äù11</p>
<p>As the Cold War came to a close, a host of new federal legislation also came into being, which provided Pueblo governments with new legal tools for engaging the nuclear complex. The Native American Graves and Repatriation Act (1990), Executive Order 13007 on Indian Sacred Sites (1996), and the Native American Religious Freedom Act (1978, Amended 1996) provide formal means of addressing cultural issues on the Pajarito Plateau, as federal agencies were now mandated to discuss cultural impacts with tribal governments. New environmental laws also came into being that allow indigenous nations to set environmental stan- dards for their lands‚Äîstandards that neighboring communities are obliged to meet. Changes in the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, as well as Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice, mandate a new rec- iprocity between neighboring communities over environmental impacts, including an awareness of the racial and cultural dimensions of federal projects. Thus, as the Soviet Union dissolved into a series of new nation- states, LANL‚Äôs position in New Mexico also fundamentally changed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>requiring new sensitivity to the nations within: put simply, after a half century of federal silence, neighboring Pueblo nations were suddenly in a position not only to set environmental standards for their territories, but to affect the upwind, uphill activities of the laboratory‚Äîallowing those without a Cold War voice to impact the post‚ÄìCold War mission of the premier nuclear weapons facility in the United States.12</p>
<p>As a result of this new legal context, and rising regional concern about Cold War environmental effects, the legal position of Pueblo nations changed significantly in the post‚ÄìCold War period. In 1992, the DOE signed accords with the four Pueblos that immediately neighbor LANL‚Äî Santa Clara, San Ildefonso, Cochiti, and Jemez Pueblos‚Äîcommitting to a ‚Äúgovernment-to-government‚Äù relationship over laboratory impacts. In 1993, the University of California sent its first delegation to New Mexico to listen to community concerns about the laboratory. On November 12, 1994, LANL signed ‚Äúgovernment-to-government‚Äù cooperative agree- ments with Santa Clara, San Ildefonso, Cochiti, and Jemez Pueblos. In 1996, the State of New Mexico moved to resolve an eighty-four-year-old conceptual and legal ambiguity over the status of Indian tribes. Meeting at the State Capitol, the twenty governors and three presidents repre- senting territories within the State of New Mexico met for the first time to recognize each other‚Äôs right to exist (see Figure 3.2). At this important post‚ÄìCold War moment, Pueblo governments were, thus, for the first time in American history, formally recognized by all the legal entities that directly impact their communities: the State of New Mexico, the Univer- sity of California, the DOE, and LANL.13</p>
<p>Collectively, these accords set up new lines of dialogue between four Pueblo governments and LANL, including plans for extensive environmen- tal monitoring of Accord Pueblo lands, a process of consultation over Pueblo cultural interests within LANL boundaries, emergency response training at the Accord Pueblos, environmental science training for Pueblo members, and ongoing discussion about new contracts and employment for Pueblo citizens (LANL 1995a; Shaner and Naranjo 1995). Thus, as neighboring Pueblo governments considered the types of environmental standards they wanted for tribal lands, they were also briefed for the first time about the environmental effects of fifty years of nuclear science on the plateau. Concurrently, laboratory officials learned about what it was like to live next to a nuclear facility and wonder about the physical and cultural impacts of nuclear science on a region of special importance to Pueblo peo- ples. These agreements represent a fundamental evolution in the history of LANL-Pueblo relations, which started in 1943 based on a ‚Äúgovernment-to- ward‚Äù relationship, were then remade over the course of the Cold War into a ‚Äúgovernment-to-citizen‚Äù dynamic (as Pueblo peoples became recognized</p>

<p>U.S. citizens), and in the post‚ÄìCold War period, became centered around a new ‚Äúgovernment-to-government‚Äù relationship.</p>
<p>The trajectory of LANL-Pueblo relations was raised at the second exe- cutive meeting between the governments of Santa Clara, San Ildefonso, Cochiti, and Jemez Pueblos and LANL, a gathering that I attended at Cochiti Pueblo in 1995. Cochiti government officials began the session by discussing how for fifty years the people of Cochiti heard explosions and watched clouds of smoke drift over their land from Los Alamos, and wondered about the health effects of those clouds and their impacts on the people, water, crops, and land. Declaring that for over fifty years Los Alamos had been a ‚Äúmystery‚Äù to the people of Cochiti, Governor Isaac Herrera underscored the need for government-to-government dialogue with the laboratory. The setting for this summit was particularly power- ful, as the Pueblo de Cochiti Recreational Center provides a breathtaking view of the Pajarito Plateau, which rises immediately to the northwest. Pointing through an enormous glass window that directly frames the mountain, Governor Herrera visually demonstrated the proximity of the laboratory to the Pueblo, and emphasized that Cochiti religious leaders continue to traverse the Jemez Range for ceremonial purposes. His pres- entation underscored the cultural intimacy his people maintain with the</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pajarito Plateau, and simultaneously, the continuing ‚Äúforeignness‚Äù of Los Alamos. This is important because the evidence of Cochiti Pueblo‚Äôs par- ticipation in the nuclear age is not only social or spiritual, but also envi- ronmental, as traces of plutonium from military science at Los Alamos National Laboratory can now be found in the sediment of Cochiti Reser- voir, located just above the Pueblo. The plutonium derives from the first decades of the Manhattan Project, when untreated radioactive effluent was discharged from laboratory facilities into canyons that ultimately flow into the Rio Grande River.14</p>
<p>In order to understand the combination of reticence and passion with which Pueblo leaders engaged LANL at the meeting, it is important to recognize the historical context of Cochiti-U.S. relations. Cochiti Reservoir was created by an act of Congress in the 1960s to relieve flood- ing downriver in Albuquerque. Built against the wishes of Cochiti Pueblo, the lake destroyed 50 percent of the tribe‚Äôs farming land. Two years after the completion of the dam in the early 1970s, water began to seep through the retaining walls onto the remaining 50 percent of Cochiti farmland, eventually submerging it under a foot of standing water (see Sando 1998: 296‚Äì98). The plutonium from laboratory opera- tions in Cochiti Lake, therefore, not only reveals a specific dimension of the plutonium economy‚Äîthe remarkable mobility of radionuclides in the ecosystem‚Äîbut also demonstrates the need to place the social and envi- ronmental effects of the laboratory in the broader historical contexts of both northeastern Pueblo cosmologies and U.S.-Pueblo relations. It also demonstrates why northeastern Pueblo engagements with Los Alamos are often interpreted as an index of U.S.-Pueblo relations more generally, standing not as an isolated relationship between a specific Pueblo and a specific laboratory project, but as a manifestation of a broader federal respect for Pueblo peoples.</p>
<p>Federal management of Pueblo lands produced fundamental changes in Pueblo societies during the twentieth century. In the decades preced- ing the launch of the Manhattan Project, the eight northern Pueblos, for example, lost title to over 18,000 acres of farmland in U.S. courts, just as their populations began to grow significantly. Unable to live off tradi- tional farming practices for the first time, most of the eastern Pueblos turned to the cash economy for their livelihoods.15 As Richard Clemmer (1984) has argued, the loss of the subsistence economy encouraged a number of Pueblos to lease their lands for coal and uranium mining, both tying their economic future to the world energy economy and plac- ing their lands (and often bodies) in the hands of corporate mining inter- ests.16 For the northern Pueblos, the economic crisis led many to search out work at the area‚Äôs largest employer, what was to become Los Alamos</p>

<p>Scientific Laboratory. Thus, one structural effect of U.S. policies toward Pueblo territories in the decades preceding the Manhattan Project was to help foment an economic crisis that coincidentally not only opened up tribal land to uranium mining, but also produced workers for those min- ing operations and for the construction of Los Alamos. Ultimately, Cold War New Mexico would produce half of the U.S. supply of uranium, providing the raw material for the U.S. nuclear weapons that were being designed at Los Alamos.</p>
<p>During World War II, Pueblo communities predominantly believed Los Alamos to be a temporary intrusion, one providing timely, if short- term, jobs in the laboratory and in the domestic economy of the town (Hawley 1948: 32‚Äì33).17 Jobs included not only construction and support positions within the laboratory, but also domestic help in Los Alamos homes. A bus service was established to bring male construction crews from neighboring Pueblos and Nuevomexicano villages to the lab- oratory, as well as women, predominantly from the neighboring Pueblos of San Ildefonso and Santa Clara, to Los Alamos to help with childcare and household chores (Brode 1960). As Los Alamos became a permanent institution, communities throughout northern New Mexico began to see the laboratory as a source of financial stability, creating a new commuter economy for communities traditionally focused inward, and eventually a multigenerational, cross-cultural investment in the laboratory. First-gen- eration employees encouraged their children to get technical training, hoping they could break out of the support jobs at the laboratory and move up the institutional hierarchy. Governor Dasheno of Santa Clara Pueblo, for example, has argued that the economic impact of the labo- ratory is a fundamental part of the larger environmental concerns of the Pueblo:</p>
<p>The flip side of the environmental concerns is the economy. The national laboratories are major players. Any change in the direction, reduction in budgets, new mission, are of vital concern to New Mexico and the Pueblos. Downsizing Los Alamos, for example, could have a devastating impact on our economy. This, too, is an environmental issue. There is no question in my mind that steps must be taken to correct the adverse environmental con- ditions, a legacy of activities at Los Alamos and Sandia over 50 years. But, we must also be perceptive of the economic changes that will occur and see a plan of mitigation that does not compromise our quality of life. (Quoted in SouthWest Organizing Project 1993: 9)</p>
<p>Thus, while the Manhattan Project provided financial relief for neigh- boring communities suddenly reliant on a cash economy in the 1940s, it has evolved into a complex source both for maintaining local Pueblo life and for cultural assimilation in northern New Mexico.18</p>
<p>MIRRORS AND APPROPRIATIONS: THE SECRET SOCIETIES OF THE PAJARITO PLATEAU</p>
<p>While there were no formal dialogues between LANL and neighboring Pueblo nations during the Cold War, communities on and around the plateau were acutely aware of and interested in one another. These logics were not only interpersonal but also structured by the prevailing logic in American society concerning Native American peoples. John Borneman (1995) has argued that Native Americans were positioned in the nine- teenth century as both the ‚Äúfirst Americans‚Äù and as the counterconcept to the American, creating a fundamental ambivalence about the legal standing of indigenous peoples. This simultaneous discourse of genealog- ical connection and radical othering informed a number of Cold War laboratory projects. Weapons scientists, for example, explicitly refer- enced Pueblo religion in their experimental work on nuclear fission, naming the laboratories where they conduct criticality research ‚Äúkivas.‚Äù Early criticality experiments involved moving blocks of fissile material close enough together to start a chain reaction and allow neutrino counts, while separating them before an explosion took place. This was done by hand and was called ‚Äútickling the dragon‚Äôs tail‚Äù due to its risk factor (Rhodes 1986: 611‚Äì12). After physicists Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin were killed tickling the dragon in 1945 and 1946, Los Alamos scientists built a new laboratory in Pajarito Canyon, the Critical Experiments Facility, where criticality measurements could be performed remotely in self-styled, high-tech kivas (Hacker 1987: 72‚Äì73). The first kiva was built in 1947, the second in 1953, and the third in 1960. Between 1947 and 1983 over 15,000 criticality experiments were per- formed in these kivas, divided between nuclear weapons projects, the Rover nuclear rocket program, and nuclear reactor research (Paxton 1981; Mortensem 1983). Thus, much of the experimental work on nuclear fission at Los Alamos was conducted in spaces explicitly refer- encing Pueblo traditions. Indeed, practices of naming, here, provide evi- dence of a curious cross-cultural investment on the plateau. An article in the internal laboratory <em>Newsbulletin</em> imagined these high-tech kivas, and their multicultural context, this way:</p>
<p>The Pajarito Plateau is dotted with ruins of ancient stone kivas. Hundreds of years ago those secret ceremonial chambers witnessed Tewa Indian priests performing mysterious religious rituals. Today in the Pajarito Canyon, three concrete and steel kivas stand not far from many of their namesakes. These kivas have witnessed what (to the unknowing) may seem to be even more mysterious rites, such as metallic hemispheres moving together and apart in the absence of humans. These ‚Äúmysterious rites‚Äù are</p>
<p></p>
<p>119</p>
<p>the activities of laboratory scientists working with critical assemblies, a mass of fissile material sufficient to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. (Mortensem 1983)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>Mirroring an imagined Tewa ritual, which is both ‚Äúancient‚Äù and ‚Äúmys- terious,‚Äù the author presents nuclear science as a new mysticism on the plateau. A laboratory history of the Pajarito Test Site pushed the analogy further, including a photograph of the first LANL kiva taken from within a nearby Pueblo ruin‚Äîvisually emphasizing both the metaphorical con- nection between structures and the implied sense of technological evolu- tion on the plateau (see Figure 3.3; Paxton 1981).</p>
<p>However, while it was possible for some LANL employees to imagine nuclear scientists channeling the spirits of Pueblo religious leaders within their high-tech kivas (see Figure 3.4), this demonstrates no engagement with the local, and living, Pueblo cultures. For example, it is quite possi- ble that the ruins in Pajarito Canyon, which provided the symbolic points of reference for LANL‚Äôs high-tech kivas, were utilized for ceremonial</p>

<p>purposes by neighboring Pueblos up to 1943 and the arrival of security fences, and would be used again if access were possible. Pueblo peoples venerate ruins because they are material points of connection to their ancestors, and are often burial sites as well (making them dangerous sites to disturb or discuss). Thus, the landscape used for the new criticality tests was not filled with the traces of a past civilization, but was part of an ongoing Pueblo cultural engagement with the plateau. Moreover, these high-tech kivas in their initial formation were also devoted to creating a military weapon, while Pueblo kivas are social spheres used both to define the community and to participate in a cosmogonic order that  deifies nature and emphasizes ‚Äúseeking life‚Äù (Laski 1958).19</p>
<p>LANL‚Äôs high-tech kivas are, however, only one area where the multi- cultural context surrounding Los Alamos has been officially referenced in the culture of the laboratory. Street names in the town of Los Alamos and meeting rooms in the laboratory‚Äôs Oppenheimer Conference Center also appear to honor  local  Pueblo  nations.  Thus,  in  the  town  of Los Alamos there is a San Ildefonso Lane, and you could meet someone at the corner of Tewa and Santa Clara Place or of Navajo and San Juan.</p>

<p>These asphalt streets cover areas of the plateau once embedded within indigenous practices, making their names a curious statement on the physical colonization of the Jemez range by the Manhattan Project. It is also, however, quite possible that these street names do not reference people at all, but rather nuclear explosions from the South Pacific above- ground testing regime, which provide names for several Los Alamos streets.</p>
<p>Operation Redwing was a test series conducted at the Bikini and Enewe- tok atolls in the South Pacific by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in 1956 (Hanson 1988: 69‚Äì75). Seventeen nuclear and thermonuclear explosions were performed between May 4 and July 17, each code- named after a Native American people. Operation Redwing was devoted to testing new weapons designs, and in doing so, unleashed over twenty megatons of power on the homelands of Pacific islanders (DOE 2000a). The initial test, Cherokee, was the first detonation of a B-52 dropped thermonuclear device, a 3.75-megaton reply to the Soviets‚Äô first test of a similar device five months earlier. The press (which had been banned from nuclear testing for several years) was invited to witness the explo- sion to make sure the message was delivered. Thus, the logics of U.S. national security produced a moment of explicit convergence: in order to send a message to the Soviet Union (the structural descendent of the ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù in the American oppositional imaginary) the genocidal poten- tial of thermonuclear military technology was displayed on indigenous territories in the Pacific with devices evoking a claim on ‚ÄúIndian-ness‚Äù through the politics of naming. Even as North American indigenous nations‚ÄîLacrosse, Cherokee, Zuni, Yuma, Erie, Seminole, Flathead, Blackfoot, Kickapoo, Osage, Inca, Dakota, Mohawk, Apache, Navajo, Tewa, Huron‚Äîwere appropriated for use as semiotic markers for the American bomb, the U.S. military personnel responsible for their use during war could imagine the nuclear battlefield itself as a kind of hos- tile ‚ÄúIndian country.‚Äù At this moment in the nuclear age, indigenous communities provided both the explicit conceptual charter and absolute oppositional reference for the U.S. national security imaginary. The five- megaton shot on July 20, code-named Tewa, for example, evoked the ‚ÄúTewa-speaking‚Äù Pueblo nations in New Mexico that then Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory bordered in northern New Mexico. Thus, just as the Tewa in New Mexico were dealing with the environmental and social effects of nuclear science at the laboratory, weapons scientists were evok- ing their name half a world away in an act of nuclear violence. The Tewa device (Figure 3.5) was detonated on a barge, creating a 129-foot-deep, 4,000-foot-diameter crater in the reef below and producing radioactive fallout that contaminated Bikini, Enewetok, and over two thousand</p>

<p>under new kinds of jurisdiction on LANL grounds, perhaps subject to search and seizure, and in some places, armed response (see Figure 3.6). Compare Figures 3.7 and 3.8. The first is a LANL road sign declaring ‚Äúthe roadway and surrounding lands are U.S. government property‚Äù and informing drivers to obey all federal, state, and laboratory rules. The sec- ond is a sign from Santa Clara Pueblo, alerting visitors to the fact that they are entering reservation lands, and are ‚Äúsubject to obey all Tribal and Federal laws within our boundaries.‚Äù This type of sign (also mark- ing San Ildefonso territories) is distinct in language and tone from the entrance signs at other Pueblos. Given that both Santa Clara and San Ildefonso identify the Jemez range as their homelands, and San Ildefonso claims the territory now occupied by LANL as ancestral lands, these signs of possession and jurisdiction take on a different political meaning, suggesting a colonial critique. Prohibitions on photography on Pueblo and LANL grounds also illustrate the mirrored levels of governmental power, as do the frequent road blocks along the Jemez: LANL shuts down roads while transporting dangerous materials each month, while neighboring Pueblos shut off access to their lands during ceremonial events they wish to keep private. In the mid-1990s, Pueblo governments established official Environmental Departments to engage the various envi- ronmental divisions at LANL, and the relationship between Los Alamos</p>

<p>In the post‚ÄìCold War era, two potent sites of national cultural mirror- imaging have emerged on the plateau, concerning the politics of archival knowledge and secrecy. Nuclear weapons science and Pueblo religion are rooted in the same physical space in northern New Mexico, bringing these radically different means of achieving safety and security into direct engagement. Both cultures rely on secrecy, a compartmentalization of knowledge, and a social hierarchy of who knows what and why, to con- trol access to social and material power. Similarly, both systems of knowledge make claims on controlling the essential powers of the uni- verse: for scientists in the form of the atom, for eastern Pueblo religious leaders via intimate understanding of the reciprocal social bonds struc- turing nature. Technoscientific knowledge about the bomb may seem to be the most religiously protected secret in the world, but consider that almost every study of eastern Pueblo religion by a non-Pueblo author begins by acknowledging a profound cross-cultural rejection of that enterprise. Take, for example, William Douglass‚Äôs 1915 essay on Tewa shrines, which begins: ‚ÄúThe Pueblo Indians guard with great tenacity the secrets of their shrines. Even when the locations have been found, they will deny their existence, plead ignorance of their meaning, or refuse to discuss the subject in any form‚Äù (1915: 344). Secrecy is therefore a long- standing, and now cross-cultural, tradition on the Pajarito Plateau‚Äîa national-cultural practice that has often prevented LANL and neighbor- ing Pueblo nations from talking to one another about their mutual investments in the same geographic space. Until 1957, Los Alamos was a gated community, completely cut off from neighboring communities except for those who worked in Los Alamos, and since 1957 the forty- three square miles of laboratory territory have been patrolled by armed guards and protected by electronic security systems. While fences have defended nuclear science from outside intervention, they have also enclosed a rival technology, an older system for maintaining balance in the world and creating security for the indigenous peoples of the north- ern Rio Grande.</p>
<p>Consider Figure 3.9, which is a laboratory illustration of the Pueblo cultural sites‚Äîancestral ruins, petroglyphs, and shrines‚Äîlocated just within the fenced boundaries of what is now LANL property  (Steen 1977). Numbering in the several thousand, these material  traces  of Pueblo culture document not only ancestral ties to the plateau but also participate in a geospiritual system for influencing nature and creating a harmonious ecosystem. For at the very least, the Pueblo shrine system is</p>

<p>a technology that historically has been used by Pueblo religious leaders to engage nature, influence flows of energy in the northern Rio Grande valley, and thereby create security for their people. Paradoxically, those sites that have not been destroyed outright by laboratory activities have been uniquely protected, hidden from the destructive onslaught of pot hunters by U.S. national security systems. Thus, LANL has unintention- ally preserved some Pueblo cultural sites, leaving them largely untouched</p>

<p>since 1943, while bulldozing and polluting others. The forty-three square miles of LANL territory, therefore, gives staff archaeologists a unique archive of the past while offering Pueblo peoples on the opposite side of the fence the possibility of a renewed connection to those, now fenced but surviving, sites in the future. Ultimately, this means that the same territorial area responsible for inventing U.S. nuclear weapons remains active in an older system of cultural knowledge, setting the stage for a powerful post‚ÄìCold War negotiation over place, power, and secrecy on the plateau.</p>
<p>For weapons scientists, the end of the Cold War created a crisis of knowledge, as the moratorium on underground nuclear testing in 1992 caught scientists by surprise, changing the ground rules for conducting weapons science. During the Cold War, nuclear weapons science was based on speed of production, planned obsolescence, and the assumption that the pursuit of new nuclear weapons (and thus, the ability to conduct underground testing) was an unending project. Consequently, weapons scientists did not collectively archive all details of their work. Instead, information was scattered in various laboratory sites on the plateau, in notes stored in individual office safes and in the heads of several generations of weapons scientists. Realizing that in a few decades, those charged with maintaining the nuclear arsenal will have no direct experience with real (as opposed to virtual) nuclear detonations, LANL began the Nuclear Weapons Archiving Project in 1993, an attempt to archive all the data gleaned from a half century of nuclear testing. The project not only is gathering together  papers  and  computer  models stored at various laboratories, offices, and test sites on the plateau (and at Livermore and Sandia), but also seeking to record the technical and intuitive details generations of weapons scientists have relied on  to design, test, and certify U.S. nuclear weapons. Weapons science has con- sequently been revealed to be a kind of folk art, grounded, at least in part, in long-term apprenticeships and oral culture, and located in mul- tiple centers on the plateau. Once completed, the archived data will be accessible to weapons scientists via a secured Internet on a ‚Äúneed to know basis‚Äù; that is, only those maintaining the highest security clear- ances in the nuclear complex will be able to access the entire computer archive, which will stand as a unique record of one regime‚Äôs activities on the plateau.</p>
<p>Concurrently, neighboring Pueblo nations began archiving their own cul- tural knowledge of the plateau in the 1990s, as part of an Environmental Impact Study (EIS) of LANL operations. The Accord Pueblos argued in 1994 for the inclusion of a ‚Äúcultural impacts‚Äù report that would depict the unique consequences for Pueblo peoples of past and future laboratory</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>activities. Pueblo officials began collecting tribal oral history of the plateau, documenting cultural uses of plants and animals while consulting religious leaders about the location and use of cultural sites. Given that the moun- tains are, at least within traditional Tewa culture, the spiritual responsibil- ity of a specific class of religious leaders (see A. Ortiz 1969, 1972), this process mirrors the nuclear archive, in that, for those communities, a small group of people is responsible for maintaining the cumulative cultural knowledge produced on the plateau.20 Moreover, given that in addition to the Tewa-speaking nations of Santa Clara and San Ildefonso, the Cochiti and Jemez nations are also involved in this archiving project, there are (like the nuclear project) multiple centers of information being explored, multi- ple communities being consulted about their investments in the plateau. Thus, for all regimes (U.S. technoscientific and Pueblo national) the ques- tion is now one of memory, of remembering the cultural import of sites that have been inaccessible to diverse Pueblo communities since 1943 and mak- ing sure that future generations understand cultural connections to those sites and that place now occupied by the laboratory.</p>
<p>The question of access to the cultural impact report also mirrors back to the nuclear complex the politics of secrecy informing U.S. weapons science. For despite the Accord Pueblos‚Äô interest in producing a cultural impacts document, Accord Pueblo cultural matters, especially those directly related to spiritual engagements with special places, are quite sim- ply, top secret. Non-Pueblo recognition of cultural sites‚Äîand particularly the existence of detailed site maps‚Äîremains controversial and a subject of intense negotiation between LANL and neighboring Pueblo govern- ments in the post‚ÄìCold War world. Under the Spanish colonial regime the Pueblos defended their religious system‚Äîfirst by military uprising in 1680 (that forced Spanish settlers out of New Mexico for twelve years), and then by closing their religious world off from public view, a tactic that endures. By preventing outsiders from viewing certain religious prac- tices, Pueblo leaders sought to compartmentalize engagements with non- Pueblo ideas, shielding them from missionaries and from cultural diffusion. Many Pueblo scholars attribute the longevity and vitality of eastern Pueblo cultures to this system of compartmentalizing, and to the fact that Pueblo nations (unlike many other indigenous communities in the United States) were never forced from their ancestral lands (A. Ortiz 1994; Sando 1992; Dozier 1961). Former governor of Cochiti Pueblo Joseph Suina, speaking in the midst of spy allegations at LANL in 1999, offered this explanation of Pueblo secrecy:</p>
<p>There is still another reason why Pueblo peoples keep secret certain things. And that‚Äôs because knowledge is used differently in the Pueblo world. In this</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>world [the laboratory], anybody can know anything if they so desire. I was going to say, except for Top Secret things. But [it seems] anybody can know anything if you have the money and the desire and the connections. Sorry LANL, but I‚Äôm here to teach you a thing or two about secrets. Knowledge in the dominant world is of that nature‚Äîif somebody so desires to know about medicine, or about law, or about social work, it is a matter of taking time to study on your own, or with somebody, or in a course. But in the pueblo world, knowledge is not used that fluidly, that open. Knowledge is used in terms of funds of knowledge, if you can call it that. Sometimes knowledge is restricted because of gender. There are things that males know</p>
<p>130	that females are not supposed to know. And there are things that women know, especially if you are a member of a religious society, that males are not supposed to know . . . My mother died many years ago, but she was a member of women‚Äôs society. And my father, and we as children, had no right to know her business. So sometimes knowledge is withheld and then given. Knowledge is made accessible based on gender. Other times it is given when people mature, it is based on maturity. And still other times, it is based on commitment. Once a person made a commitment to serve in some capacity for the rest of their lives for the people, then they can have access to the knowledge. For anyone to tamper with knowledge, or to pry into, is courting serious, serious trouble.</p>
<p><em>Knowledge is not used that fluidly.</em>  The arrival of the Manhattan Project on  the  Pajarito  Plateau  thus  not  only  brought  together   multiple secret societies‚Äîthose supporting U.S. military nuclear science and Pueblo theocracies‚Äîbut also rival systems of knowledge and knowing. Conse- quently, silence on a given topic can mean many things within Pueblo soci- eties, and cannot be dismissed as either implicit support or a lack of interest, as secrecy is a longstanding strategy of cultural survival and internal social regulation.</p>
<p>Pueblo practices of secrecy are not only a means of negotiating a colo- nial experience, but are connected to Pueblo notions of power, which are connected to a unique combination of place and emotional clarity (see Pandey 1977).21 Pilgrimages, for example, historically could not take place unless participants had a positive and undivided psychological investment in the purity of the process (e.g., Curtis 1970: 9). As Parsons noted in 1939, for the Pueblos, ‚Äúsecretiveness is founded on the concept or feeling that power communicated is power lost‚Äù (1996: 434). Thus, one of the central attributes of northeastern Pueblo secrecy is an empha- sis on maintaining the quality of their engagement with specific places and ritual practices, which require that knowledge remains located within the ritual hierarchies of the tribe. In this sense, the national secu- rity culture of Los Alamos mirrors back to the Accord Pueblo nations their longstanding concerns about secrecy and power, as Parsons‚Äôs quote could equally well be applied to how nuclear weapons data is treated in</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the United States: for in the world of military nuclear science ‚Äúpower communicated‚Äù is also experienced as power lost.22 Accord Pueblo lead- ers have, therefore, made clear that the cultural impact report will only be pursued if it is kept secret, if they control who has access to the infor- mation and under what terms. Thus, in effect, they are mirroring what is done in the realm of U.S. military science, where information classified by the United States is written up in a separate document only accessible to those with the proper security clearances and on a ‚Äúneed to know‚Äù basis. The difference here is that four sovereign Pueblo governments will be in control of their own knowledge base, allowing future Pueblo lead- ers to evaluate laboratory activities, making the report a strategic‚Äîand highly classified‚Äîtool for the Accord Pueblos to use in their engage- ments with Los Alamos and DOE officials, who may or may not ever have access to the report.</p>
<p>Thus, in the immediate post‚ÄìCold War period, the national cultures on and around the Pajarito Plateau are archiving knowledge produced in their historic and everyday engagements with that shared space. While each of these national entities practice a compartmentalizing of knowl- edge as well as a ritual hierarchy limiting access to information, they are now directly concerned with generational reproduction‚Äîwith maintain- ing cultural investments in specific sites and specific activities on the plateau. Pursuing their national security, then, from very different per- spectives, all parties are now concerned about the long-term environmen- tal and political viability of their engagement with that shared space. For mediating both of these archiving projects is, of course, a third: one involving the environmental impacts of Cold War nuclear science, which in the early 1990s was expected to be a $2 billion cleanup involving 2,100 sites on the plateau (DOE 1995a). From a cultural perspective, then, the ownership of the plateau remains in question, as two rival systems for achieving security require access to the same space. Some Pueblo nations are now reflecting back to Los Alamos the experience of being shut out of a national security culture, using religious secrecy to protect their investments in the plateau and take advantage of laboratory resources‚Äî gaining computers, environmental training, and cash in this post‚ÄìCold War cycle of exchange. Indeed, given that environmental and religious matters are so intertwined for Pueblo peoples, the key legal tools for Accord Pueblo engagements with LANL‚Äîenvironmental law and rights to religious freedom‚Äîforce northeastern Pueblo governments to evoke secrecy rules in their political mobilizing. Thus, while Pueblo nations have used secrecy as a way of mediating a colonial experience since the seven- teenth   century,   the   top-secret   projects   of   the   twenty-first-century</p>
<p>U.S. nuclear complex will be balanced by a rival system of national</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>secrecy on the Pajarito Plateau capable of affecting laboratory operations. Thus, the future promises a more explicit mirror-imaging between neigh- boring regimes that are now engaged not only in ‚Äúgovernment-to-gov- ernment‚Äù relationships but also in defining national security around centers of protected knowledge, knowledge produced on and embedded within the Pajarito Plateau.</p>
<p>132	EXPLOSIVE TESTING</p>
<p>The plutonium economy, however, has also created new millennial chal- lenges for the Pueblo communities living adjacent to the Pajarito Plateau. For the Jemez range is now a sacred space invaded by the trace elements of military nuclear science‚Äîplutonium, strontium, cesium, tritium‚Äîa reality that not only threatens to disturb  the  relationship  between humans, plants, animals, air, soil, and water by producing an increas- ingly toxic future, but also presents unknown spiritual consequences for Pueblo peoples. Gregory Cajete (Santa Clara) commented on the origins of Los Alamos at the LANL 2000 conference, noting not only the eco- nomic benefits of the laboratory and town site‚Äîa half century of employment for Santa Clara Pueblo‚Äîbut also the environmental justice implications of locating a toxic military project on top of the northern Rio Grande valley:</p>
<p>Being from Santa Clara Pueblo, which is only about 19 miles away [from Los Alamos], I grew up very much within the context of the Los Alamos aura, so to speak. Very few people that I know in one way or another were not associated or were not in one way or another working for Los Alamos or working at Los Alamos. My mother, for instance, was a housekeeper for many, many years in Los Alamos and babysat and kept house for many of the scientists and technical people that were up there. I think my experience and my sense of Los Alamos has always been a very interesting one. We in the valley considered Los Alamos this very strange, almost like Mt. Olympus place. I remember that as I was growing up we used to talk and wonder about what was going on at Los Alamos. And also we would reflect on how different the people from Los Alamos were, not only in terms of students and people that were up there but also the kinds of things that were a part of that whole community, because largely Los Alamos kept to itself. It began primarily as a scientific city, a secret city. There are many stories as to why the lab was located at Los Alamos. One of them, of course, was because of its isolation, because of its ideal location [for military science]. But also I think because of the fact that it was being put in a place where if something did indeed go wrong it wouldn‚Äôt affect too many people. And the people it would affect, in a sense, in that time and that place, were</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>considered, I think, in some ways of thinking, almost expendable. I ulti- mately always reflected on that and thought about that orientation. If you‚Äôre growing up in the valley you have a lot of relatives and people that work in Los Alamos but they always come back to the valley. Very, very few people from the valley moved up to Los Alamos and became a part of that community.23</p>
<p><em>There are many stories as to why the  lab  was  located  at  Los Alamos</em>. This articulation of local dependence and sacrifice simultane- ously underscores the continuing ‚Äúforeignness‚Äù of Los Alamos to many who live in the valley but also offers an evaluation of the meaning of U.S. citizenship for the northeastern Pueblos. Cajete suggests here that indige- nous peoples were not officially part of the national order and therefore ‚Äúexpendable,‚Äù making the long-term effects of LANL activities on the plateau also an index of the meaning of U.S. citizenship for Pueblo peo- ples, who are now intimately tied (by virtue of labor and place) to the production of U.S. national security. The plutonium economy therefore engages multiple registers of northeastern Pueblo experience, evoking a complex negotiation of economic advancement and colonialism, U.S. citizenship, and religious desecration‚Äîall of which problematize the future for communities who are uniquely invested in a specific territorial space, living in the shadow of a nuclear facility. Remarkably, it was only after the end of the Cold War that the first official discussion of the environmental and sociocultural impacts of locating the laboratory on the Pajarito Plateau took place, as communities throughout the northern Rio Grande valley pondered the future of LANL while learning new details about its past. The end of the Cold War thus began the local process of replacing official silence with proliferating fields of risk, concerning the environmental, economic, and sociocultural impacts of the laboratory.</p>
<p>We can see the logistics of this shift in perception in one of the first pub- lic confrontations between LANL and neighboring Pueblo nations at the end of the Cold War. A proposal by LANL scientists in 1992 to test the geothermal makeup of the Jemez Mountain Range by detonating a string of underground explosions along the Rio Grande Rift was vehemently protested by officials from Cochiti and Santa Clara Pueblos on religious grounds. The experiment was designed to test for molten rock underneath the Valles Caldera by detonating at least six one-ton charges of TNT in 140-foot-deep shafts along a 110-mile stretch of the Jemez Mountain Range. The collective seismic information gathered from these blasts would enable a three-dimensional portrait of the geology of the Valles Caldera. As a nonmilitary, non-nuclear project designed to understand geothermal energy‚Äîa potential new energy source‚Äîthe experiment</p>

<p>would seem to be less controversial than many Cold War nuclear experi- ments conducted on the plateau, but the end of the Cold War marked a dramatic shift in community engagements with the laboratory. The first explosion was to be conducted underneath Cochiti Lake, followed by a chain of explosions running the length of the Jemez range. Government leaders from Cochiti and Santa Clara Pueblos learned about the proposed tests in newspaper reports, just as an environmental impact assessment of the proposed experiment was coming to a close. Arguing not only that tribal governments had not been informed about the experiment but also that the explosions constituted an act of religious desecration, Pueblo offi- cials threatened legal action. Santa Clara Governor  Walter  Dasheno stated that the vibrations from the explosions would impact shrines and archaeological sites on the Jemez range and unequivocally declared that the violation of the earth in these areas was in and of itself culturally destructive. LANL and the U.S. Forest Service countered that none of the tests took place on tribal property and pointed out that in 1991 the Jemez range had experienced some 230 earthquakes of equivalent or  lesser force, assuring that the planned detonations would produce no damage to archaeological ruins or religious sites.</p>
<p>LANL arguments about the frequency of earthquakes did not, how- ever, recognize the distinction that would be drawn in Pueblo traditions between a natural seismic event and an artificially created one. Eastern Pueblo cultures recognize‚Äîand venerate‚Äîthe evolution in natural forms over time through erosion and decay; the cumulative impact of explo- sives testing on the ecosystem threatened the purity of those processes, potentially unleashing dangerous spiritual forces and affecting the larger chain of reciprocal relations in nature. LANL officials ultimately moved to accommodate Cochiti and Santa Clara concerns by eliminating the first proposed test underneath Cochiti Lake, and then  by  replacing several explosives tests in the central Jemez range with passive, nonexplosive experiments. The experiment continued but in a signifi- cantly abridged form, alerting all governmental and technoscientific agencies that communities along the northern Rio  Grande  were  no longer passive witnesses to laboratory technoscience (Baldridge et al. 1997). Indeed, this collision between communities evoking radically dif- ferent concepts of space‚Äîinvolving land as private property, as techno- scientific project, and as sacred space‚Äîenergized a new relationship between LANL and neighboring Pueblo governments. It also confirmed for many living around Los Alamos that northern New Mexico remains an experimental test area, raising new kinds of fears about  what  the future entails and about what the Cold War plutonium economy leaves in its wake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protests over the proposed Valles Caldera experiments also engaged longer-term concerns by neighboring communities over LANL experi- mentation on the Pajarito Plateau, concerns that were silenced by the national security logics of the Cold War. For in the realm of quotidian experience, one of the most visceral engagements with the plutonium economy for those living immediately adjacent to  the  laboratory  has been the sound of explosions echoing from canyon test sites. The unan- nounced concussions from LANL explosives testing have become over the past half century a common intrusion into everyday life for those living in the shadow of the Pajarito Plateau, a startling reminder of LANL‚Äôs presence and ongoing commitment to military technologies. Many of these explosions have been, and are, devoted to perfecting the military science and technology of implosion.</p>
<p>Implosion is a means of creating a nuclear chain reaction by encasing a sphere of plutonium within a shell of high explosives and then detonating the explosives in such a way that a highly symmetrical and inward-moving shockwave is produced. This shockwave uniformly com- presses the plutonium sphere in an instant, triggering a chain reaction that releases energy on an unprecedented scale. An elegant, and eco- nomical, if technologically challenging design, implosion remains one of Los Alamos‚Äôs unique contributions to the world and perhaps the first major achievement of the Manhattan Project. The first implosion device was also the first atomic bomb, detonated at the Trinity site in New Mexico on July 16, 1945; the second was detonated three weeks later over Nagasaki. As one of the key technologies of the Cold War, implo- sion designs not only enabled a sphere of plutonium the size of a grape- fruit to level a city, but also allowed, through a constant refinement in the engineering process, nuclear weapons to shrink from several-ton behemoths to small devices that could be mounted on the tip of an inter- continental missile. Consequently, implosion technologies remain at the center of U.S. nuclear weapons science and a subject of ongoing research at LANL. Indeed, Los Alamos remains perhaps the world leader in the science and application of conventional high explosives, maintaining extensive explosive test areas on the Pajarito Plateau where the intrica- cies of creating perfectly symmetrical, inward-directed explosive charges are now a multigenerational project.</p>
<p>During the first two decades of the Manhattan Project, weapons sci- entists worked on improving implosion designs for U.S. nuclear weapons through explosives testing at Bayo Canyon, which is located three miles east of the Los Alamos town site and which runs eastward down the plateau onto the lands of San Ildefonso Pueblo. From September 1944 through March 1962, scientists conducted 254 implosion experiments</p>

<p>using high explosives around a core of lanthanium-140 (used as a surrogate for plutonium, which was both too expensive and too danger- ous for these tests; see Figure 3.10). Lanthanium-140 is an intensely radioactive but short-lived isotope, with a half-life of just forty hours. Averaging about one test a month during the eighteen-year life of the program, the RaLa experiments released a total of 250,000 curies of radioactive lanthanium, plus traces of strontium-90, barium-140, and cesium-140, into the local environment in the form of radioactive fall- out. Fallout was blown over the plateau, requiring the fire department on at least one occasion to wash down the highways leading into  Los Alamos, and on several other occasions to erect roadblocks. During sev- eral tests, fallout also was documented over the northern Rio Grande valley. In 1950, for example, the U.S. Air Force tracked fallout clouds from the  RaLa  program  as  a  means  of  preparing  for  full-scale nuclear tests at the Enewetok Atoll in the South Pacific. On March 24, 1950, the U.S. Air Force measured fallout over San Ildefonso, Santa Clara, and Espa√±ola (Dummer et al. 1997: 9‚Äì10). Cumulative doses to those living in Los Alamos and adjacent Pueblos are estimated (by recent LANL dose reconstruction studies) to have been low but the politics of the RaLa program nevertheless reveal how indigenous communities fig- ured within a Cold War mind-set at Los Alamos, and correspondingly</p>

<p>frame contemporary attitudes toward the laboratory from those who live the valley.</p>
<p>Test protocols for the RaLa experiments required wind to be moving in a northeasterly direction prior to the test, which would take fallout away from the Los Alamos town site (the most immediate populated area) but direct it toward the Pueblo communities of San Ildefonso, Santa Clara, and Pojoaque, as well as the town of Espa√±ola. Describing the region to the north and northeast as ‚Äúunpopulated areas,‚Äù the test protocols appear to have ignored the existence of neighboring communities. Moreover, while scientists monitored for fallout, they did not inform tribal, state, or city governments about the test program. Indeed, the first communication between LANL and neighboring Pueblo nations about the environmental effects of the RaLa experiments came in 1994, thirty years after their completion, as a result of the President‚Äôs Advisory Commission on Human Radiation Experiments.24 At a volatile meeting of the advisory committee in Santa Fe, George Voelz, a LANL physician who studies the long-term effects of plutonium on the human body, explained the regional logics behind the test protocols in this way:</p>
<p>My own personal opinion, having known some of the people, was that the laboratory management really felt they had a responsibility for protecting the people who were in the area, and that was part of the planning and part of the checking in terms of these radiation measurements and things that were done at the time these tests were being run, and they were interpret- ing whether they were creating a problem or not, and I think they accepted that as part of their responsibility. Now, what they didn‚Äôt do is what you asked earlier. As far as I know, there was not much communication going on with the people in the area, and that, in retrospect, was a mistake. It‚Äôs something that we learned subsequently, and we now have laws and regu- lations and environmental impact statements and all of the rest that have come on, partly to amend some of these procedures that we didn‚Äôt do ear- lier. Part of the protection, of course, as these tests went on was that the quadrant that we just talked about, that the cloud would go toward unpopulated areas, and so there were Native Americans (<em>sic</em>). I think kind of the generic term that was used was Espa√±ola, but there is Santa Clara, San Juan‚ÄîSan Juan from above, and San Ildefonso Pueblo to the east, and we likely tried to exclude (I say ‚Äúwe,‚Äù the laboratory‚ÄîI don‚Äôt have much party to any of these decisions) to exclude those populated areas the best they could. So, I think they were trying to meet their responsibilities, but they weren‚Äôt talking about it.25</p>
<p>Given, however, that there are no documents‚Äîor local memory‚Äîof explicit engagement between the laboratory and neighboring communities over matters of health, safety, or emergency planning until the waning days of the Cold War in the late 1980s, Pueblo officials must take an</p>

<p>astonishing leap of faith to accept that regional safety was of foremost concern during these experiments. At best the laboratory‚Äôs stance toward neighboring communities during the first decades of the Manhattan Project was paternalistic. However, such a position is complicated by the fact that Pueblo people were involved in the  RaLa  project‚Äîhired  in 1963 to clean up the Bayo Canyon site at the conclusion of the test series. Provided with film badges (for radiation dose calculations), work gloves, and burlap bags, Pueblo firefighting teams for Zia and Jemez Pueblos spent several weeks picking up debris from eighteen years of explosive testing, physically removing ninety truckloads of refuse from the canyon floor (see Figure 3.11). The material removed from Bayo Canyon was taken to Area G, one of the laboratory‚Äôs radioactive waste burial sites located three canyons to the southwest of the test site (Courtright 1963; Ferenbaugh et al. 1982).</p>
<p>Thus, the RaLa tests exist simultaneously in two opposed narrative reg- isters. A U.S. national narrative forwards the technoscientific value of the tests in enabling the development and refinement of implosive plutonium weapons at a time of intense national need‚Äîa time when the experiments were believed to pose little risk to the public, but when the fate of the entire United States seemed to be at stake. A more local post‚ÄìCold War narrative, however, forwards the effects of the RaLa tests on the valley and focuses on the environmental justice questions they raise. The RaLa experiments ener- gize an experience of the nuclear uncanny for many, as the health risks from exposure to fallout and radioactive debris, and the long-term effects of explosive testing and nuclear waste storage on the mountain raise funda- mental questions about the safety of Pueblo lived spaces. The logics of national sacrifice are manifold in these experiments, not only in terms of testing protocols, cleanup, and waste storage, but also in the spectacle of air force exercises over northern New Mexico to track fallout. Each aspect of the RaLa program therefore raises basic questions about the position of northeastern Pueblo communities within the United States, and can only be read in the context of the larger history of U.S. military practices in the Southwest. We should remember that when the RaLa experiments began in 1943 Pueblo peoples had only the promise of U.S. citizenship‚Äînot gaining the right to vote until 1948‚Äîand it was only after the Cold War that the Accord Pueblos began to be informed officially about the scope of laboratory activities. As the Advisory Commission on Human Radiation Experiments concluded about the RaLa tests, U.S. government ‚Äúcredibility is the casualty of silence and secrecy‚Äù along the northern Rio Grande (1996: 333).</p>
<p>One area where a loss of credibility is of immediate import is in eval- uating the long-term health risks to neighboring communities of LANL</p>

<p>activities. Although the laboratory maintains world-class expertise in nuclear sciences, the official silence of the Cold War has made it difficult for many in the valley to accept laboratory statements about past or present environmental risks, fueling experiences of the nuclear uncanny. As one Tewa spokesman put it:</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt trust the lab leadership to deal honestly with the Pueblos and pro- tect their interests. For 50 years we heard nothing from them. It took groups like the Los Alamos Study Group and Concerned Citizens for Nuclear Safety to alert us to the environmental dangers in the late 1980s. Prior to that nobody thought about health issues related to Los Alamos. Today, we are not really concerned about the politics of the bomb, as deci- sions to fight wars are made so far away from us. But we are scared about the environmental effects. We want to know why we have so many cancers.</p>
<p><em>We want to know why we have so many cancers</em>. When I asked him about his own experience with LANL, he told me about two relatives who had worked at the laboratory in the first decades of the Manhattan Project. Both had held support jobs, and had not only enjoyed their work, but had also felt that people in Los Alamos always ‚Äútreated them</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>right.‚Äù However, both developed cancer, which they, and their family, now attribute to their work at the laboratory. One relative remembers being asked to clean something up one day at the laboratory, only to dis- cover later that he should have been wearing protective gear, initiating lifelong concerns about radiation exposure. In the northern Rio Grande valley, there are many similar stories about Pueblo, Nuevomexicano, and Anglo workers who were ill-trained or poorly supervised in how to deal with nuclear materials, and who now have cancer, fueling a racial and class critique of Los Alamos as a colonial institution. Such stories also reveal experiences of the nuclear uncanny, promoting fears not only about environmental contamination and a world filled with invisible dangers, but also of loved ones sacrificed to cancer by U.S. governmen- tal neglect or malfeasance. A lived-space and a politicosocial sphere are equally contaminated by fears of radiation from U.S. national activities, making it difficult for many Pueblo members to accept the technoscien- tific conclusions of LANL scientists about health and safety.</p>
<p>Native Americans in New Mexico experience significantly higher rates of cancer than other ethnic groups. This is a startling change from the first decades of this century, when cancer was such a rare occurrence among Native Americans that some specialists thought they were ‚Äúimmune‚Äù to the disease (Manhoney and Michalek 1998). Since the dawn of the nuclear age, however, cancer has become a leading cause of death among Native Americans throughout North America. In New Mexico, this same period witnessed important changes in the local envi- ronment and the diet of Pueblo peoples as well as severely limited access to health care in some rural areas. Nevertheless, the rapid increase in cancer rates nationwide remains a largely unexplained phenomenon (Manhoney and Michalek 1998). In the context of Cold War secrecy and raising cancer rates, LANL has become a primary suspect for communi- ties dealing with devastating illness. San Ildefonso Pueblo announced in the early 1990s that they have documented increased rates of cancer going back to the founding of the Manhattan Project; they also publicly questioned the veracity of LANL‚Äôs health studies. Indeed, at the end of the Cold War, the immediate problem was that the laboratory had lost credibility on health and safety issues, but Pueblo nations had limited financial resources and technical expertise with which to conduct their own studies. Moreover, health studies of cancer rely on statistical por- traits that are often irreconcilable with the small-scale communities of northern New Mexico. At one public hearing to discuss environmental LANL environmental impacts, a San Ildefonso official replied to a statistical portrait of health in the area by stating: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with what you‚Äôve said here tonight. For you one cancer out of 100,000 is</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>justifiable, for me one cancer out of 700 (tribal members) is not acceptable. Your statistics do not take into account the proximity of the Pueblos to the land‚Äîwe are the most impacted.‚Äù At a similar hearing to discuss the statistically documented fourfold excess of thyroid cancer witnessed in Los Alamos, a Tewa resident of the valley sat quietly through a series of presentations largely attributing the cancer rates to aggressive screening for cancer at Los Alamos hospitals. In response, he said that many Pueblo do not trust the Indian Health Service to record accurately causes of death, claiming that some people who have died of cancer have had other causes of death listed on their death certificates, which has skewed the official cancer rates for those living in the shadow of Los Alamos. Storming out of the meeting in anger, he shouted, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sick, we know we‚Äôre sick, and you hide behind these ‚Äòstudies‚Äô!‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus, while the sound of explosives testing is the sign of technoscien- tific progress for those involved in military science, for neighboring communities, who are not often privy to the details of nuclear science at Los Alamos, these concussions figure on the periphery of daily life, as an unpredictable intrusion that startles, literally shaking one‚Äôs home and raising a host of questions about environmental and religious desecra- tion, U.S. governmental intent, and the possibility of life-changing ill- ness. This auditory dimension of the plutonium economy, then, reiterates the foreignness of LANL to those living outside the national security fence, underscoring its power as a U.S. national space that, for many, is unknowable except in its after-effects, and thereby working to under- mine how people experience their immediate tactile universe. For people who culturally identify with the land and live close to it‚Äîusing adobe for their homes, making pots out of local clay for a living, using local plants for ceremonial purposes (for body paint, medicine, and religious prac- tices) in addition to ranching, farming, and hunting‚Äîto raise fundamen- tal questions about environmental safety is to challenge the viability of an entire way of life. In that light, consider the aftermath of an explo- sives test. Explosives testing disperses shrapnel and fallout over a wide area, producing elements that are subject to winds, water runoff, animal and plant consumption, and geological transport. Cleaning up test sites is an enormous technoscientific undertaking, an enterprise that is much more difficult than producing the explosion itself.</p>
<p>Consider Bayo Canyon, which has not served as a LANL test area since John F. Kennedy was president. It was first declared ‚Äúclean‚Äù in 1963, then again in 1966, 1967, 1971, 1973, 1975, and 1976 after remediation efforts in each of those years (Ferenbaugh et al. 1982).

<p>canyon have continued to surface, requiring renewed action and regular monitoring throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Elk (a traditional food for the northeastern Pueblos) living on LANL property have been found to have higher levels of strontium-90 in  their  bones  than  elk  living off-site. Noting that LANL security fences throughout the plateau have impacted the migratory patterns of animals, Pueblo representatives have voiced concerns about a declining elk population on the plateau over the past fifty years and also about the health risk to humans who eat elk wintering on laboratory  land.  Risks  to  game  animals  are  not  only from grazing on contaminated plants, but also  from  drinking  liquid waste discharges from laboratory facilities (of which there are 123 on LANL property, some fenced, some not). Thus, even the first decades of implosive testing for U.S. nuclear weapons, taken in isolation from ongoing laboratory activities, have  an  enduring  environmental  and social legacy on the plateau (LANL 1995a; Shaner and Naranjo 1995; DOE 1998b).</p>
<p>Indeed, from this perspective, it is difficult to imagine what an end to the Manhattan Project would actually look like on the plateau, when exactly the trace elements of the first half century of the nuclear age will not be coursing through the Jemez Mountains‚Äô ecosystem. LANL has undertaken not only environmental studies of soil, water, and air on the Pajarito Plateau but also of fish (salmon, trout, catfish, and carp) from neighboring lakes, animals (elk and small mammals), plants (chamisa shrubs and pi√±on trees), and vegetables (pinto beans, sweet corn, and zucchini squash). Samples are taken not only from the Accord Pueblos and regional sources throughout northern New Mexico, but also from laboratory land. All show the traces of atmospheric fallout from above- ground nuclear explosions‚Äîa significant percentage of which were LANL designs‚Äîmarking their baseline participation in the global plutonium economy. Vegetables grown on laboratory land in Los Alamos Canyon, however, which runs the length of the Jemez to the east through six and a half miles of LANL property, to San Ildefonso land, and eventually to the Rio Grande, are more distinct creatures of the nuclear age (Fresquez et al. 1997). In response to requests from San Ildefonso Pueblo, LANL scientists in 1996 mapped the most contaminated area of Los Alamos Canyon (which has received fifty years of radioactive discharge from laboratory facilities) and planted crops. The staple crops of the northeastern Pueblos‚Äîpinto beans, sweet corn, and zucchini squash‚Äîall revealed significantly elevated rates of radionuclides; strontium-90, cesium-132, americium-241, and pluto- nium-238, -239, -240 were absorbed from the soil into the crops in levels dangerous to people.26 These gardens document a fundamental change in</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ecocultural regimes in the past half century. Prior crops grown in the area were for human sustenance and, in the case of Pueblo peoples, were tied to a specific, religiously sanctioned ecology (see Ford 1992). Today, however, the staple crops of northeastern Pueblo peoples are grown in Los Alamos Canyon simply to track radioactive contamina- tion, to measure the impact of U.S. nuclear science on the mountain ecosystem.</p>
<p>The cumulative effects of nuclear science at LANL have produced a new intimacy with nature on the plateau as environmental scientists now seek out a portrait of the health of the entire ecosystem. Unlike the cul- tural intimacy of Pueblo cultures with this ecosystem (which involved neither industrial effects nor the unpredictable effects of new elements like plutonium), environmental scientists are now involved primarily in tracking damage to the ecosystem. The increase in environmental moni- toring after the Cold War illustrates, then, not only a new priority in lab- oratory engagements with the plateau but also the fundamental concern local communities have about the world they live in, fundamental con- cerns about the toxicity of their environment and the safety of their daily food and water. Indeed, environmental sampling has become a new cross-cultural project in the post‚ÄìCold War era, as LANL scientists, Pueblo representatives, as well as officials from the Bureau of Indian Affairs are now conducting redundant tests of air, water, soil, plants, and animals as a way not only of defining the level of risk to Pueblo citizens, but also of documenting the veracity of LANL science for Accord Pueblo leaders.</p>
<p>Because public statements about the cultural consequences of environ- mental contamination or the disruption of sacred sites are restricted by Pueblo practices of secrecy and cultural compartmentalization, it is important to underscore that the full import of the Manhattan Project for these diverse communities is unknown to outsiders and may remain so. As Rina Swentzell (Santa Clara) reminds us:</p>
<p>Pueblo reality is very much in the observable, sensory world‚Äîeven the spir- its dwell in the nearby mountains, lakes and streams. Within this sensory world, the possibility of multiple levels of existence are recognized. These levels, however, are not abstracted and relegated to a place after death, but rather are physically connected to this world through mountains, tunnels, and lakes. The structuring of the ecological environment corresponds with the notion that supernatural forces share the same physical, temporal world as natural forces, thereby creating an overall environment sometimes full of unexplainable events. The world, then, contains mysteries that cannot always be explained by rational human powers. Spiritual forces are a rec- ognized part of everyday life and human beings are part of a sanctified life.

<p><em>The world, then, contains mysteries</em>. In an animated universe where supernatural as well as quantifiable physical forces are at work, adher- ence to U.S. governmental standards for radiation exposure may only be a first step in evaluating the ecological integrity of the plateau.27 As one northeastern Pueblo official related to me: ‚ÄúPeople up on the hill think of us down here in the valley as uneducated and not able to understand what they‚Äôre doing. They always analyze. To me a miracle is a miracle. I‚Äôm not going to analyze it. But to them everything gets taken apart.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus, while LANL environmental monitoring can identify specific pathways at specific sites throughout the Pajarito Plateau (allowing an understanding of, say, the amount of beryllium in soil at ‚ÄúX‚Äù site), Accord Pueblo officials have been equally concerned with understanding the cumulative effects of all LANL activities on the total ecosystem. This is a much more difficult assignment, and one that requires a great deal of trust between laboratory scientists and Pueblo officials. Thus, even if Pueblo governments and LANL scientists can agree on the quantifiable health risks to Pueblo communities from past and present LANL activi- ties, this only engages the most immediate set of concerns for Pueblo leaders, namely, the physical health of their communities. For nations who ground their identity on an intimate connection to the earth, and utilize plant metaphors to describe their origin and engagement with the universe, the effects of the plutonium economy are not only quantifiable health risks, but also the unique cosmological repercussions of a mate- rial and symbolic colonization, of discovering a radioactive plant, a van- ished shrine, a polluted spring, or a toxic honeybee on ancestral lands.</p>
<p>NUCLEAR NATIONS: THE SOVEREIGNTY OF NUCLEAR WASTE</p>
<p>What we are told as children is that people, when we walk on the land, leave their sweat and leave their breath wherever they go. So that wherever we walk, the place, that particular spot on the earth never for- gets us. And when we go back to those [ancestral] places we know that the people who lived there are in some ways, still there, and we can actually partake of their breath and of their spirit. And that‚Äôs another incredible source of power.</p>
<p>‚ÄîRina Swentzell (Santa Clara) from the film, <em>Surviving Columbus: The Story of the Pueblo People</em></p>
<p>Plutonium is eroding and being transported through the system at a rate not likely to exhaust the total inventory (including the fallout on the</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>landscape of the upper watershed) for  more  than  2,000  years.  If  the rates of erosion and transport in Los Alamos canyon observed over the past 40 years prevail, the canyon will contribute plutonium from Los Alamos for 100 to 600 years depending on the magnitude of the original inventory . . . For the next several hundred years, Cochiti Reservoir will continue to store sediments and plutonium in increasing amounts from upstream sources. The continued pollution, albeit by small amounts, is a historical inevitability.</p>
<p>‚ÄîWilliam Graf, <em>Plutonium in the Rio Grande</em></p>
<p>The Cold War plutonium economy inaugurated a multimillennial process along the northern Rio Grande, a new cycle of environmental and social exchange where radioactive materials from the U.S. nuclear project, injected into the mountain ecosystem, are now mobile elements, pursuing an unpredictable course dictated by invisible processes and environmental flows. Slowly working their way through and off the mountain, some of these radionuclides are now both unstoppable and all but  eternal,  thereby  articulating  a  new,  postnuclear  ecosystem   in New Mexico. The Manhattan  Project  transformed  northern  New Mexico into an enormous biosocial experiment, one in which  toxic agents, military technoscience, and the cultural logics informing lived, indigenous spaces now interact in perpetuity. As Figure 3.12 demon- strates, plutonium is now more than merely a spectral presence on the plateau and in the valley. For the Pueblo nations who have lived in the shadow of the Pajarito Plateau since time immemorial the future now involves new kinds of risk. Indeed, the relationship between plutonium and  the  plateau‚Äîa   240,000-year   engagement   now   barely   fifty years old‚Äîis perhaps only matched by northeastern Pueblo cultural commitments to the same space, a region where they believe they always have lived and always will live. Now landlocked by historic colonial processes and private property law, most Pueblo nations have little space in which to move physically, making the plutonium economy also a form of toxic colonialism. For these island nations are defenseless from past and future radiological impacts, as the invisible materials from past and future U.S. national security practices cross their territories, revealing themselves only in their effects. Indeed, because the social and environ- mental effects of the Cold War plutonium economy will radiate long into the future, it is important to consider the futures now being made along the northern Rio Grande, and particularly the social mutations that nec- essarily follow in their wake.</p>

<p>The DOE has recently ruled that any permanent nuclear waste depos- itory in the United States must have an operative plan that would make it safe for not a day less than ten thousand years. Such a plan is unprece- dented in human history, though still accounting for only a fraction of the life span of the most dangerous nuclear materials, which will remain radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years. Nevertheless, consider the astonishing confidence the standard reveals, the certainty it registers about the future, and the eternal reliability of the American nation-state. Can we imagine a state that lasts one thousand years, let alone ten thou- sand? The closest we might come to such national cultural longevity in North America is the Pueblo nations of New Mexico, which have lived in their current areas at least since the twelfth century and inhabited the greater Southwest for perhaps seven thousand years. Thus, the commu- nities now faced with the millennial threats of the nuclear complex are also the oldest communities in North America, peoples who maintain unique cultural commitments to living in the specific spaces they now occupy. It is necessary, then, to evaluate the regional effects of the Manhattan Project on a millennial time frame, not only because the</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>nuclear materials will be circulating long into the future, but also because northeastern Pueblo nations remain committed to place on an equally millennial scale.</p>
<p>While stable at end of the twentieth century, the millennial future of these sites is subject to unpredictable natural processes making the safety of the plateau and larger ecosystem necessarily a matter of unending sur- veillance. In fact, the U.S. effort to contain the Soviet Union spatially and politically through nuclear weapons during the forty-plus years of the Cold War is now eclipsed by the millennial challenge of spatially con- taining the industrial effects of the U.S. nuclear arsenal at Los Alamos and other nuclear production sites. Off the Pajarito Plateau, the most immediate impacts of the plutonium economy fall on San Ildefonso Pueblo, which lies directly downwind and downstream from the labora- tory. Officials at San Ildefonso self-identify as the only indigenous com- munity in the United States sharing a territorial border with a DOE nuclear facility. Moreover, the Pajarito Plateau is San Ildefonso‚Äôs ances- tral homeland, a place tied to their emergence, populated with physical links to a unique geospiritual ecology. Pueblo officials have identified over 1,500 sites of cultural importance located within the current labo- ratory boundaries and have pursued an aboriginal land claim in U.S. courts since the mid-1960s for return of the plateau. The Pueblo is not only seeking legal recognition of its historic use of the plateau but also remuneration for a specific national exchange at the launch of the Man- hattan Project. Oral history at San Ildefonso documents a gift of land in late 1942 from the Pueblo to the Manhattan Project to help in the war effort, land that Pueblo officials believed would be returned after the war, but which remains behind the U.S. national security fence to this day. San Ildefonso and Los Alamos are thus linked through their com- peting claims in the same physical space. Today, LANL occupies 27,832 acres of land, while San Ildefonso occupies some 28,136, but these boundaries are the result of a U.S. national process, not traditional use, making it difficult to identify realistically where Los Alamos ends and San Ildefonso begins. The environmental consequences of laboratory activities, therefore, engage a space that is multiply contested, making it uncertain whose national regime will ultimately bear the millennial costs of the U.S. plutonium economy.</p>
<p>Negotiating these multiple, and contradictory, claims on the plateau is a new, post‚ÄìCold War project, one requiring a delicate dance concerning cross-cultural issues of secrecy, respect, and national authority. At a meeting to discuss a transfer of land from the DOE to Los Alamos County, and potentially to San Ildefonso, a  Pueblo  representative engaged laboratory officials this way:</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>Even though that property sits now in the hands of the United States government ... we would certainly like to have the opportunity to make sure they are protected to the best of our abilities, and to let the Department [of Energy] know that you have an enormous number of sites that have been identified through your professional services that are available, but there are still sites that we have not disclosed for reasons of our own secrecy and protection of those sites that we are not willing to disclose to anyone other than our own people. We need to have those things protected as best we can. It behooves me in the sense that we are looking at an area, and we are talking about 300 acres, and right within that 300 acres, I can say that</p>
<p>148	there is something very significant that we have not told you about, and those areas adjacent as we see them. I think we need to make sure that we are protected. This great country of ours can go up there during the most recent war, the Gulf War, and tell its allies and its own soldiers not to destroy anything of religious significance in a time of war, but why can‚Äôt we do it right in the back door where we are living in peace, and where we want to work together and do some of these things jointly? . . . When I go to the National Cemetery, I walk on the sidewalks or the paths that are there to go visit my uncles, or brother, or other relatives that are buried there. We just don‚Äôt walk across those things. I think that is the dignity that we want to be at rest with, and that we want to share these situations with [you], to remind you. Remember in the back of your minds that, as you step on us, should you step on us, the only way down off that hill is through our lands. We have to work together and look at these things.28</p>
<p><em>The only way down off that hill is through our lands</em>. The Pueblo representative concluded by stating that while occasionally there has been talk about blowing up the bridge that crosses San Ildefonso lands and allows commuter access to Los Alamos, tribal members are invested in building a healthy, respectful relationship with the laboratory and federal officials. Underscoring that the federal laws enabling and maintaining Los Alamos rarely recognize Pueblo claims, he evoked the sacrifices Pueblo members have made for the United States, not only in terms of land lost to Los Alamos but also in direct U.S. military service.29 Asking for the same consideration given to U.S. enemies during wartime, he asks for the protection of sacred sites on indigenous territories colonized by a nuclear- powered regime. Defending the United States globally, while being threat- ened by the United States locally, are simultaneous realties for Pueblo communities living next to the laboratory, raising important issues about the meaning of U.S. citizenship and the future viability of the plateau and valley as lived spaces.</p>
<p>In this light, consider the reality of Area G, LANL‚Äôs primary nuclear waste site: located on a thin mesa called the Mesita del Buey, Area G occupies a physical space that traverses the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù border between LANL and San Ildefonso (see Figure 3.13).30 Area G is a national</p>

<p>sacrifice zone. The unresolved question is‚Äîfor whose nation? A place that is now in the center of these rival claims on space, Area G opened in 1957 with the bulldozing of five Pueblo ruins. Each new burial pit has erased ruins and cultural sites that serve as points of reference for Pueblo peoples generally, and San Ildefonso in particular.31 Area G grew throughout the Cold War to accommodate LANL‚Äôs nuclear waste pro- duction, evolving from a five-acre site in 1957 to a thirty-seven-acre site in 1976 to a sixty-three-acre site in 1993, thereby offering a peculiar index of U.S. national investments in the plateau. The growth of Area G, however, comes at the expense of historical Pueblo investments in the plateau, which in 1957 included, by LANL measurements, sixty-nine archaeological sites. Area G became a highly politicized regional issue in the early 1990s, when antinuclear groups and Pueblo officials learned of plans to more than double the size of the nuclear waste site. The planned seventy-acre expansion would destroy more archaeological sites on the mesa and threaten a nearby  spring,  as  well  as  make  Area  G  the largest nuclear dump in New Mexico and perhaps the largest in  the United States. In light of intense regional activism, the expansion has been put on hold until after an environmental impact study can be completed.32</p>

<p>side of the radiation warning fences are deep ravines filled with Ponderosa pine and pi√±on trees. Down below to the west is San Ildefonso land, an area used for ceremonial purposes, for hunting, and for the gathering of plants. If you visit Area G today you will pass by several Pueblo ruins (which are carefully flagged and fenced off) and see dozens of cement plugs sticking out of the ground, noting where shafts of tritium- and plutonium-contaminated waste were buried. Alongside the football field sized open pits, neatly packed with containers of radioactive contami- nated waste, are fences posted with radioactive warning signs, and constant reminders to workers to promote safety, signs written in English and Spanish but not in Tewa or Keresan. Through these fences, the view of the plateau and the valley is fantastic. Ancient Pueblo peoples liked it too, taking advantage of an elevated site that was also one of the few naturally flat areas on the plateau for farming. Plants at Area G today, however, participate directly in the plutonium economy. The pi√±on trees that prior to the Manhattan Project fed Pueblo families now maintain plutonium in their circulatory system at a rate one hundred times greater than background levels, as do local grasses. Similarly, honeybees and honey collected from hives at Area G consistently record the highest levels of tritium contamination of any LANL site.33</p>
<p>The buried nuclear waste at Area G presents a multimillennial hazard. Indeed, the federal dream of a ten thousand-year safety net around these materials is already problematic. An underground plume of solvents and tritium from leaking canisters is making its way off the plateau, and there is evidence of tritium contamination in soils and runoff as well. Area G is of particular concern at San Ildefonso, not only because of the remaining cultural sites on and around the mesa, but also because traces of tritium have been found recently in water wells at San Ildefonso, suggesting that radioactive materials from LANL may be making their way through the mountain toward the deep aquifer.34 The aquifer feeds the water system of the northern Rio Grande valley and is, from both a traditional Pueblo point of view and a technoscientific point of view, the source of life in the region. It is also ancient. Water in the main aquifer varies in age from one thousand years old under the western edge of the Pajarito Plateau to nearly thirty thousand years old underneath the valley (LANL 1995b: VII-31). It takes at least one thousand-years for surface water to work its way through the mountain to regenerate the deep aquifer, proving a new index of the possible effects of laboratory activities, which the DOE now acknowledges operate on a ten thousand-year time frame. Thus, from a northeastern Pueblo (indeed, a regional) perspective, Area G can appear as nothing less than a time bomb. LANL predicts, for example, that an</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>earthquake capable of doing structural damage to all laboratory facilities will occur sometime during the next 2,300 to 14,000 years on the Pajarito Plateau (DOE 1998b: 5‚Äì84). While this offers a reasonable assurance of safety from a Euro-American, technoscientific focus on the present, Pueblo peoples can already claim a residence of nearly ten thousand years in the area, and proceed with the assumption that they will be living in the same spaces ten thousand years from now. The Accord Pueblos are now mobilizing to address the millennial threat by training a new gener- ation of environmental scientists, whose job will largely be to monitor LANL‚Äôs radioactive threats. Area G ensures that the past half century of social change caused by the Manhattan Project on the plateau is simply the first step in a millennial process in which local communities, and rooted Pueblo nations in particular, will be adapting to the new, postnu- clear ecology of the northern Rio Grande valley.</p>
<p>If, for example, we follow the effects of the Cold War plutonium econ- omy one community to the east in the northern Rio Grande valley, to Pojoaque Pueblo, which lies immediately adjacent to San Ildefonso and fifteen miles north of Santa Fe, we find a very different articulation of a plutonium-mediated national security. Pojoaque is a nation with a trou- bled history. It has, as Governor Jacob Viarrial says, ‚Äúdied twice‚Äù due to epidemics in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and was only recon- stituted in the 1930s, maintaining a population today of less than two hundred. A new, post‚ÄìCold War aspect of the plutonium economy was revealed at Pojoaque in the mid-1990s, with the announcement that the Pueblo planned to pursue storage of U.S. nuclear waste as a form of eco- nomic development. While shocking to many non-Pueblo residents of the valley, Pojoaque was merely responding to an invitation from the DOE, which in 1991 approached all Native American governments soliciting interest in nuclear waste storage projects on tribal lands. The DOE pro- posal was, and is, a response to the political gridlock surrounding the dis- posal of nuclear waste in the United States. It is also part of a larger post‚ÄìCold War process in which new recognition of the sovereignty of indigenous nations is quickly followed by invitations from federal bureaucracies and corporations for politically unpopular, environ- mentally dangerous projects.35 In the Southwest, this trend promises to complete the nuclear life cycle in Indian country, performing the last step in a ‚Äúcradle-to-grave‚Äù nuclear economy‚Äîfrom uranium mining to nuclear weapons design and testing to nuclear waste storage. The DOE plan promises financial independence for the small-scale communities of northern New Mexico. Indigenous nations interested merely in learn- ing about ‚ÄúMonitored Retrievable Storage‚Äù (MRS) receive $100,000 up</p>

<p>front from the DOE, and up to $3 million more‚Äîcommitment-free‚Äîif willing to perform a formal site analysis. At least $10 million per year in profits can be expected from an MRS facility, whose lifetime is ultimately tied to the creation of a permanent U.S. nuclear waste site, which remains decades away (see Erickson et al. 1994: 78‚Äì82; Hanson 1998; Kuletz 1998). With potentially a quarter-billion dollars at stake over the next twenty-five years, it is not surprising, then, that when reporters asked Pojoaque Lieutenant Governor George Rivera why the Pueblo  would even consider bringing nuclear materials onto tribal land, he simply replied, because ‚Äúthere‚Äôs instant millions to be made.‚Äù36 Joe Sando (Jemez) has argued: ‚Äúthe most critical task facing the Pueblo Indians is the development of an economy capable of sustaining the people‚Äù (1992: 105). Lucrative nuclear projects have repeatedly presented themselves to indigenous communities in the wake of faltering or failed subsistence economies, offering immediate financial relief to those who are consis- tently among the poorest in the United States.37 Indeed, as one northern Pueblo official confided to me in the mid-1990s, the primary grounds for publicly affirming Pueblo sovereignty in New Mexico are ‚Äúnuclear waste and casino gaming.‚Äù</p>
<p>This is important because Pojoaque‚Äôs MRS announcement  was,  in large part, also a political tactic designed to underscore what was at stake for the Pueblo in debates over casino gaming. The government at Pojoaque Pueblo has been among the most vocal supporters of Indian gaming in New Mexico. Its ‚ÄúCities of Gold‚Äù casino is among the most successful casinos in the state, playing off the ancient myth of the seven golden cities of Cibola that energized the Spanish conquest of the South- west, and extracting money with almost surgical irony, from the mostly Spanish-speaking counties of northern New Mexico (see Figure 3.14). The legality of Pueblo gaming operations in U.S. courts, however, remained clouded throughout the 1990s,  even  though  compacts  had been signed by the governor of New Mexico and approved by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior and then renegotiated with the New Mexico state government. The ambiguity and indeterminacy of this political and legal process viscerally demonstrates how state and federal disagree- ments over the legal status of indigenous territories affect tribal efforts to pursue their own self-interest. Pojoaque Governor Viarrial vehemently protested state attacks on casino gambling in actions ranging from burn- ing a ceremonial cane given to the Pueblo by then governor of New Mex- ico, Bruce King, to undertaking a hunger strike in 1994.38 In 1996, when signed gaming compacts were once again thrown into legal doubt and tribal casinos were ordered by federal authorities to shut down, Governor Viarrial held political rallies in the state capital in Santa Fe. He also</p>

<p>targeted the commuters to LANL, by threatening to post a toll on the main highway in northern New Mexico, which runs through Pojoaque land north and northwest to Los Alamos. On March 21, 1996, Pojoaque made good its threat, stopping the morning commute along highway 84/285, which runs from Santa Fe to Los Alamos, affecting about 40 percent of LANL‚Äôs workforce. Tribal officials handed out leaflets (see Figure 3.15) to stalled motorists advocating the benefits of casino gam- ing for their community and promising toll roads as a replacement for con- fiscated slot machines.39</p>
<p>Nuclear waste storage projects remained a background threat throughout these negotiations. At a public hearing on the proposal, Gov- ernor Viarrial explained it this way:</p>
<p>When we want to get something accomplished, we have plan A, and plan</p>
<p>B. Long time ago we talked about the storage of nuclear waste. But we said let us try traditional economic development. So we opened up retail busi- nesses. And like I said earlier they haven‚Äôt always made a profit. They haven‚Äôt given us enough money to send our kids to college, the things I mentioned earlier. And when the government decided about Indian Gam- ing, we said that‚Äôs the way to go‚Äîlet‚Äôs do Indian Gaming. But we can‚Äôt fight</p>

<p>everybody . . . So that brings me to the issue of nuclear waste. We‚Äôve looked at it in the past but just in passing, to get a feeling about what was out there in nuclear waste. But now that we are fighting this battle, and it appears that the legislators might take [gaming] away from us or dilute it, we are thinking about it again. And that‚Äôs why I am asking you for your help in convincing the legislature to leave us alone, to let us try to accomplish what we need to accomplish through Indian Gaming in the way that Congress intended it to be done. We do have the legal authority to do it. We don‚Äôt want nuclear waste more than anybody else, but we know it‚Äôs very lucra- tive. And we are going to do a feasibility study. And if we are backed up into a corner, there is a good chance that within the next few months we will be deciding what kind of nuclear waste we are going to be putting in</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>our lands. When we make that decision, the public is going to say ‚Äúwhat can we do to change your minds?‚Äù I think by that time it will be too late; the time to help us make that decision is now. You need to help us change the attitude of the direction that the legislature is going now. Some people will call it blackmail, some people will say it‚Äôs holding a hammer over some- body‚Äôs head. Yes, it is. And it‚Äôs survival.</p>
<p><em>We have the legal right to do it.</em> In their public announcement, Pojoaque representatives specifically stated that they were interested in storing plutonium from dismantled U.S. nuclear weapons, precisely the weapons that were designed a few miles up the road at LANL. Pojoaque officials attempted to play off public fears of nuclear waste in nearby Santa Fe to press their claims about tribal gaming. At this rau- cous public hearing, residents of the valley were visibly upset and tried to talk Governor Viarrial out of the MRS plan. A six-year Anglo resident of the valley suggested that the tribe did not know what it was doing; stat- ing that ‚Äúthe government promises you everything but twenty years down the line your children are being born without fingers,‚Äù he argued that Pojoaque needed to be better capitalists, to ‚Äúwork harder than any- body else‚Äù and not take shortcuts to financial independence. A Nuevomexicana resident of the valley, on the other hand, argued against the MRS project by appealing to a shared citizenship and sense of neighborliness; she told Governor Viarrial, ‚ÄúThere is such a thing as being a good American, and in being a true American, which I do believe you are.‚Äù</p>
<p>What was implicit in this meeting was not only fear of nuclear mate- rial but also of Pojoaque‚Äôs ability to handle it safely. Nobody commented on the fact that Los Alamos maintains large inventories of nuclear mate- rials or has established at least eight nuclear waste sites less than twenty miles away on the Pajarito Plateau. Moreover, appeals to capitalism and American nationalism failed to recognize that these processes have explicitly worked against indigenous interests, creating the economic context that makes nuclear waste storage seem reasonable to some tribal authorities. Pojoaque Pueblo‚Äôs tactical consideration of placing a nuclear waste site on tribal lands is both an example of the high-stakes interna- tional politics that have taken place around nuclear materials in New Mexico since 1943, and a new political strategy in which plutonium is one necessary tool of statecraft. Thus, as the national security of San Ildefonso is threatened by the environmental and social costs of the lab- oratory‚Äôs nuclear waste sites, neighboring Pojoaque can forward nuclear waste storage as a means of achieving its own national security. For both Pueblos, their position is a direct consequence of the interior colonial dynamic between Native American nations and the United States: while</p>

<p>no indigenous nation currently produces nuclear waste, all are potential candidates for the disposal of the nuclear materials produced by the U.S. nuclear complex.</p>
<p>While for the past five hundred years indigenous nations have been to one degree or another ‚Äúrisk societies,‚Äù subject to colonization, dislocation, and legal disenfranchisement, the advent of the plutonium economy has brought new kinds of resources and risks, as the invisible toxins of the nuclear complex not only affect bodies and territories, but also national identities, experiences of citizenship, and systems of knowledge (see Beck 1992; Churchill 1997; Kuletz 1998; Petryna 2002). Some northeastern Pueblo communities are now remaking their nations to negotiate the effects of the nuclear age, producing among other things new constituen- cies of environmental scientists, and potentially, nuclear waste engineers. The millennial presence of nuclear materials in and along the northern Rio Grande will ensure that these social transformations are merely the first regional adaptation to a postnuclear ecology that is still in its infancy. Put differently, to understand the changing regimes on the plateau we might contemplate the future ruins that will populate that space. Joining Pueblo ancestral sites, which are part of an elaborate geospiritual order for con- trolling nature and endowing health on their communities, are now radioactive waste sites, housing in shafts, pits, trenches, and pads a legacy of U.S. national security that must now forever be contained. The distant future will still have to negotiate these sites, which will need to be tended, not as Pueblo sites have been tended in order to produce health, but rather to prevent illness and pollution. In this light, plutonium is revealed to tran- scend both time and space, becoming a material chronotope troubling Pueblo pasts, presents, and futures. For individual Pueblo nations, the con- sequences of this exchange will necessarily assume a millennial course, perhaps ensuring that plutonium, through an entirely subversive and dan- gerous course, proves a basic tenet of Pueblo cosmology: that part can indeed influence the whole.</p>
<p>ECONATIONALISMS IN THE PLUTONIUM ECONOMY</p>
<p>In the years to come, the invisibility of radiation in the northern Rio Grande valley will undoubtedly continue to make visible new forms of national consciousness among the northeastern Pueblos, as it already has in the post‚ÄìCold War period. This is not an unfamiliar phenomenon in the nuclear age. Jane Dawson (1996) has argued that a significant component in the dissolution of the Soviet Union was the econationalist sentiment engendered by the Chernobyl accident and the internal fear of</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>similar nuclear disasters among member states. Tracing the development of antinuclear sentiment in several Soviet states during the perestroika period, Dawson documents how the unique psychosocial and ecological attributes of nuclear technologies can be turned on the national order that created them. Indeed, her reading of the tactical manipulation of nuclear fear in the states of the former Soviet Union, reveals that just as nuclear technologies are the basis for ‚Äúsuper-power status,‚Äù the constel- lation of issues nuclear technologies evoke‚Äîinvolving center/periphery politics, environmental justice, and everyday forms of (in)security‚Äîcan also be mobilized by communities to attain new national standings. On these antinuclear econationalist movements, she writes (1996: 168‚Äì69):</p>
<p>While Chernobyl and the threat of a nuclear disaster may have provided the initial impetus for mobilization, the movement eventually became a way in which participants came to understand their new identity in a rapidly changing world. As the old order was first challenged then rapidly discred- ited during the perestroika period and after, people were left disoriented. With their cognitive maps shattered, citizens of the former USSR were forced to take a new look at their world and reassess their own identity within it.</p>
<p>Dawson concludes that the econationalism engendered by nuclear poli- tics in former Soviet states was ultimately based on a ‚Äúsuperficial‚Äù investment in environmental politics, for after 1991, the newly inde- pendent states did not immediately eliminate their nuclear weapons or nuclear power plants, and energy-starved Ukraine even began discussing starting up the remaining nuclear reactors at the Chernobyl site (see also Petryna 2002). Thus, while demonstrating the power of nuclear politics in energizing national, econational, and counternational movements, the Soviet example nevertheless also illustrates how nuclear politics can serve also a merely tactical role in mobilizing public sentiment.</p>
<p>Northeastern Pueblo nations similarly awoke at the end of the Cold War in a very different world, one filled with the sudden revelations of past, present, and future threats from the U.S. nuclear complex. Unlike the tactical econationalist movements in the former Soviet Union, how- ever, northeastern Pueblo nations maintain unique and long-term invest- ments in the northern Rio Grande valley, which remains part of a geospiritual order founded in mythohistorical practice. Thus rather than mobilizing against the laboratory (which would threaten the largest employer in the region and leave behind the radioactive legacy of the Cold War), the Accord Pueblos used econationalist arguments to lever- age a new political and legal standing in relation to LANL. The Cold War silence concerning LANL was transformed after 1992 into new</p>

<p>federal, state, and laboratory recognitions of Pueblo sovereignty, creat- ing new lines of dialogue as well as new exchanges of ideas, technology, jobs, and cash. The northeastern Pueblo communities who have lived with the local effects of nuclear science since the dawn of the atomic age now have every incentive to invest more thoroughly in LANL, looking to it for answers to a host of social, economic, and political problems while doing so in avowedly econationalist terms. For example, when I asked one Tewa spokesman if his government had ever considered succeeding from the United States, he replied: ‚Äúwe talk about it all of the time, but the question is‚Äîwhat will it get us, how would we be better off?‚Äù The new post‚ÄìCold War context around LANL now provides new means of articulating Pueblo nationalist sentiment, without giving up access to federal resources or embracing territorial isolation. In this sense, the new government-to-government relationships with the DOE and LANL are like a domestic Pueblo version of the 1991 Nunn-Lugar Amendment, which deployed Los Alamos expertise in the states of the former Soviet Union to secure nuclear materials after the Cold War. In both cases, the nuclear potential of another state is positioned as an immediate national security concern, requiring an explicit mobilization and engagement across international political lines.</p>
<p>New articulations of what might best be called eco-<em>ethno</em>-nationalism have allowed the Accord Pueblos to begin to chart a new future in regard to ongoing LANL activities as well as the environmental legacies of the Cold War. This new type of nationalist discourse (part ecological move- ment, part political strategy, and part cultural survival) is reinforced by the primary legal tools that Pueblo nations have for engaging the labo- ratory, which involve environmental standards and issues of religious freedom. These legal domains engage precisely the cultural logics of place that uniquely inform Pueblo investments in the mountains, rivers, plants, and animals of the northern Rio Grande valley. Thus, the experi- ences of life downwind and downstream from a major nuclear facility, in combination with the logics of federal Indian law, encourage new econa- tionalist discourses in northern New Mexico. These new articulations of national belonging are not merely tactical attempts to mobilize regional sentiment but also strategic means of engaging the long-term effects of living within the plutonium economy. While LANL created the environ- mental risk in building the U.S. nuclear arsenal, it also maintains state-of-the-art expertise in environmental science and educational pro- grams for Pueblo citizens. The post‚ÄìCold War period has revealed not only the multiple ecological, social, and political regimes on the Pajarito Plateau, but also the need for new cross-cultural exchanges. While nego- tiating the arrival of radioactive plants, animals, insects, and nuclear</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>waste, Pueblo nations now have access to sites on the plateau that were fenced off for fifty-odd years, allowing indigenous communities to renew cultural connections to those ancestral places. Similarly, a new political and economic dynamic allows these same communities to pursue the technoscientific tools needed to monitor the physical health of their communities, their national territories, and their  ancestral  homelands. The nuclear materials buried on the plateau, however, remain in their infancy. Thus, while indigenous communities have entered an important new phase in the social life of plutonium along the northern Rio Grande, this post‚ÄìCold War moment remains a very early chapter in a multimil- lennial process, one promising many new biosocial orders yet to come.</p>
