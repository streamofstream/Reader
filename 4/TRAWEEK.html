<p><strong>Pilgrim&#39;s Progress</strong></p>
<p><strong>Male Tales Told during a Life in Physics</strong></p>
<p><strong>SHARON TRAWEEK</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ike many social groups that do not reproduce themselves biologically, the experimental particle physics community renews itself by training novices. Gradually, the young physicists learn the diverse criteria for a successful career. This transmission of meaning</p>
<p>occurs not only in formal education, but also in the daily routines and in &quot;the informal annota­ tions of everyday experience called common sense,&quot; including stories cold within this almost exclusively male community about important people and events.1 In chis chapter, I cell the tale of a pilgrim&#39;s progress in physics. It is by making progress on this journey that the pilgrim becomes a scientist. The journey itself is marked by the telling of moral tales. The five tales I shall recount are about anxiety and time, success and failure, and I shall attempt to explain how these stories could only be men&#39;s stories.</p>
<p>There are three stages in the education of American particle physicists: undergraduate train­ ing, graduate school, and research associate appointment, which together comprise about fifteen years in a physicist&#39;s life. Typically, only the third of these stages is played out within the precincts of a major lab like SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center); only at the completion of all three stages does one become a full-fledged member of the particle physics community. Each stage is marked by distinctive intellectual qualities which the novice must display; each stage also cultivates certain emotional states.2</p>
<p>Undergraduate physics students, to be successful, must display a high degree of intellectual</p>
<p>skill, particularly in analogical chinking. The students learn from textbooks whose interpretation of physics is not to be challenged; in fact, it is not to be seen as interpretation. They learn to devalue past science because it is thought to provide no significant information about the cur­ rent canon of physics, but they also learn, from stories in their textbooks, chat there is a great gap between the heroes of science and their own limited capacities. It is not until graduate school that avuncular advisers introduce the older students to the particle physics community and cau­ tiously allow them to see themselves as members of it; through stories of success and failure, sto­ ries about the work of the generation now in power, they teach the novices a style of &quot;doing&quot; physics and a &quot;nose&quot; for good issues. Graduate students also learn to be meticulous and very hard working.</p>

<p>Self-assertion and bravado muse be added in the third stage, when the &quot;scudents&quot;-having earned their Ph.D.&#39;s-become research associates. This desired ethos stands in counterpoint to, yet must include, the meticulousness and patience of the earlier phase. The &quot;postdocs&quot; begin to learn and communicate about physics orally, rather than through books and articles. They culti­ vate competitive and acerbic conversation to display independence and a contempt for medioc­ rity. They learn stories about those in recent generations who have &quot;made it&quot;; from these stories they realize how important it is to anticipate the future. Only at che completion of these first three stages can a postdoc become a full-fledged member of the particle physics community. Even so, about 75 percent leave the field after this fifteen-year training period.</p>
<p>Each stage has its characteristic anxiety: for the undergraduate it is a fear chat one&#39;s own capacities are insignificant in comparison with those of &quot;real scientists,&quot; or even inadequate to win admission to the community. Graduate students are afraid of using up their predoctoral years working for a team whose experiments may prove unproductive; afraid of losing their chance at success by losing time. Postdocs are looking two or three years ahead, trying to antici­ pate rewarding questions in physics; they become anxious about the future.</p>
<p>These anxieties do not disappear when the postdoc gains a permanent position; the fears of the full-fledged member of the community combine all those of the novice (fear of the accom­ plishments or others, fear of losing present time, fear of the future coming too fast), in some­ what revised form. The established physicists are afraid chat they will not <em>continue</em> making significant contributions, that they and their work will become obsolete. These fourfold anxi­ eties are indeed inwardly experienced, but they have been learned and cultivated in the commu­ nity. It is, in part, by these anxieties that we can identify these physicists as members of their cuJture. In the context of a training period, the novices are learning to want passionately to do what they should by associating emotional states <strong>with</strong> certain activities.</p>
<h1 id='undergraduate-students-instruction\tin-the-margins-of-physics'><strong>UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS: INSTRUCTION	IN THE MARGINS OF PHYSICS</strong></h1>
<p>Physics is introduced first to the undergraduate in a textbook. The instructors, who are pre­ sented as experts on physics (although not specialists in all subfields simultaneously), explain the material in the textbook. Students are given &quot;problem sets&quot; to solve in order to demonstrate their comprehension of the material. In &quot;easy&quot; problems, the students merely &quot;plug&quot; data into the appropriate mathematical formulae. Harder problems require the students either to recognize data in an unfamiliar form and see that it can be analyzed in ways that have already been learned, or to pick our which known formulae will serve to analyze data which are perhaps deceptively familiar. Discussion clarifies how these choices are made correctly, given the students&#39; level of understanding.</p>
<p>Students also learn stereotypic experiments in highly choreographed laboratory courses. They rarely design an experiment themselves; instead they learn the classic steps in executing an experiment properly. They learn how co calculate the predicted range of error in the data, correct for it, and then analyze the data, according to certain conventional models.</p>
<p>Teachers show students how to recognize that a new problem is like this or chat familiar</p>
<p>PILGRIM&#39;S PROGRESS</p>
<p>problem; in this introduction to the repertoire of soluble problems to be memorized, the student is taught not induction or deduction but analogic thinking.3</p>
<p><em>Quantum Physics,</em> by Eyvind H. Wichmann, is a textbook that many of the postdoctoral researchers interviewed for this study once used as third-year undergraduates. It presents its top­ ics as unfolding logically. The sequence of the presentation and the use of adverbial phrases (&quot;around the turn of the century,&quot; &quot;then,&quot; &quot;today,&quot; &quot;now,&quot; &quot;to date&quot;) implies that the ideas that constitute the current canon of physics actually emerged chronologically in this &quot;logical&quot; order. The students are being introduced, subtly, to the physics community&#39;s image of its history and the place of history in its present. Practicing particle physicists look to the past only for the direct antecedents of the present; they are interested in their immediate predecessors who can be labeled the heroic discoverers of current, supposedly correct, scientific ideas. Their history of physics is a short hagiography and a list of miracles. It is this history that they teach their stu­ dents: a set of oral traditions about heroes and antiheroes, detectors, and examples of &quot;good physics judgment.&quot; The physicists&#39; knowledge of these legends usually extends back only to their own student days; beyond this, they know only of those predecessors who can be seen as having</p>
<p>anticipated current ideas.4</p>
<p>In the margins ofWichmann&#39;s text, the heroes of particle physics are identified.<em>5</em> These scien­ tific giants are shown from the waist up, alone in an office, or in a portrait pose which includes only their heads and shoulders. The rhetoric of these images underlines the outward physical</p>
<p>similarity of the men, their apparent social conformity (all but one are wearing jackets and ties), and their freedom from any particular social context (the backgrounds are blank or neutral). In another, more recent, textbook a very different photographic image-that of Richard Feynman grinning, body askew, playing bongo drums-relies heavily upon the more familiar genre for contrast.6 In the Wichmann text Einstein, in a crumpled sweater, is the only one not wearing a suit.7 Sommerfeld, in a hat and suit, is the only one shown outdoors (the background is out of focus). The images also reinforce the message that all major scientists are male. Ten are gazing away from the cameras, suggesting internal meditation; five are looking challengingly at the viewer.</p>
<p>A brief caption gives the man&#39;s birthdate and place, date of death, universities attended as a student, date of award of the Ph.D., academic positions held, references to early studies if these were not in physics, and the topics of his significant scientific work. Note is also made of any emigration from one country to another.</p>
<p>There is, it seems to me, a cluster of subliminal messages in these picture captions: that sci­ ence is the product of individual great men; that this product is independent of all social or political contexts; that all knowledge is dependent upon or derivative from physics; that only a very few physicists will be invited into the community of particle physics; and that the bound­ aries of particle physics are rigidly defined.</p>
<p>Regarding their scientific activity as supranational and supracultural is a way for physicists to isolate their community from conflicts between their countries and maintain the stable commu­ nications network necessary for their work. The movement of Germans to Great Britain or Japanese to the United States in certain years suggests that physicists are above politics and nationalism, although political duress can threaten the proper pursuit of physics. Scientists of all nationalities-Swiss, German, Italian, Scottish, English, French, Australian, Polish, American, and Japanese-look as alike as possible in this portrait gallery, signifying that culture is not an issue among them. Listing the names and varied birthplaces again suggests that scientists emerge</p>
<p>in all cultures; the implication is that science and an aptitude for it are independent of variables like culture. Most physicists would argue that there are no cultural influences on their activities as scientists.</p>
<p>Shifts in fields of study noted in the captions suggest that physics is of more inuinsic interest for great minds than the fields they chose to leave, such as chemistry, engineering, and history. In one book for high school physics students, particle physics is represented as &quot;the spearhead of our penetration into the unknown.&quot;8 (Phallic imagery is found in much of the informal dis­ course of the male particle physicists. I know of no study of the role of sexual and sexist language in the training of any occupational groups, but such speech is abundantly present in every stage ofa scientist&#39;s education.)9 Particle physicists share the assumption that this spearhead has a shaft extending behind it; after chemistry and engineering comes biology, followed perhaps by the social sciences and humanities. They would also agree that the scale of intelligence and of rea­ soning capacity needed to practice these various specialties corresponds to this sequence, with particle physics the most demanding and humanities the least. Significantly, the fine arts and mathematics are not ranked in this hierarchy of knowledge. Each of them is thought to share with particle physics certain crucial characteristics: art and physics both require creative imagi­ nation; exceptional rigor in analysis is needed in both physics and mathematics. Thus, particle physics is presumed to include what is best about art and mathematics, while excluding the rest. The boundaries are finely drawn. Theoretical physicists may be chastised by their peers for being &quot;too mathematical,&quot; or, alternatively, for lacking &quot;physical intuition&quot; or &quot;cooking up schemes out of air.&quot; Experimentalists must guard against being seen as routinized &quot;engineers&quot; or, on the other hand, as preoccupied with bravura innovations in machine-craft.</p>
<p>Students also learn in Wichmann&#39;s margins what is to be excluded from their field of scien­</p>
<p>tific study. One figure in the textbook shows a simple electric motor. The caption asserts that although its operation is to be explained in terms of quantum mechanics by a particle physicist, its design and construction should be in terms of classical electromagnetism and classical mechanics-the domain of engineers. The caption of another figure implies that the commer­ cialized, popular understanding of science is merely fanciful and bears no relation to the proper study of particle physics. Women are caricatured physically and intellectually. A figure entitled &quot;The Linear Scale of Things&quot; graphically ranks the vast domain of physical things dependent upon elementary particles and their interactions. There is an inverse relation in the things repre­ sented between size and seriousness; the upper end of the scale is exemplified by &quot;cure&quot; and/or irritating creatures, from nude females to   fleas. Undergraduate physics students are being asked to shift their attention from what is visible and emotionally engaging to the lower end of the scale, which the text proposes is fundamental, where nature is no longer accessible to the naked or optically aided eye.</p>
<p>Beyond these messages in the margin, there are instructions for the students in the body of the text, about their own status as novice physicists. They learn that information taught at each stage is often distorted or partial, a very rough approximation of the truth, which is to be dis­ closed at later stages. Novices are thought to be unsuited to a full disclosure of truth in these first years.10 Stephen Brush has used textbooks from the Berkeley Physics Course Series to show that the students are urged to assume that they are not going to be an Einstein or Dirac but merely soldiers in the ranks who must learn the established rules for puzzle solving within the existing theories.11 Recall that Francis Bacon in the <em>New Organon</em> advocated his method of investigation precisely because it enabled even the most conventional minds to make solid contributions.12</p>
<p>According to the Wichmann text, the gap between the students and the heroes identified in the margins is quite large.</p>
<p>These pictures and captions are consistent with what Brush describes as the &quot;public image of scientists as rational, open-minded investigators, proceeding methodically, grounded incontro­ vertibly in the outcome of controlled experiments, and seeking objectively for the truth.&quot;13 According to this idealized image of science and the scientist, rewards in the form of prizes, appointments, and publication are bestowed on those who conform to an ethos of science which values, in Robert Merton&#39;s terms, &quot;humility, universalism, organized skepticism, disinterested­ ness, communism of intellectual property, originality, rationality, and individualism&quot;-inciden­ tally implying that these values are not incompatible.14 A senior physicist at SLAC told me he thinks Merton&#39;s description corresponds to &quot;an adolescent fantasy which keeps the students working&quot; through their graduate school years and into the postdoctoral period, when they begin to get some rewards. A sociologist has reported that one of his respondents (a scientist) &quot;indi­ cated that the only people who took the idea of the purely objective scientist literally and seri­ ously were the general public or the beginning science student.&quot;15 Brush also finds that this rhetoric of disinterestedness is used explicitly to inspire young students to pursue a career in science.16</p>
<p>These textbook images of the scientist-hero, his personality and his exploits, have much in</p>
<p>common with the fictional mode of romance. The narrative mode will change as the neophyte advances in training to become a physicist; but the image of the scientist as romantic hero has a significant place in shaping the first phase of initiation. Northrop Frye characterizes the roman­ tic hero as a most exceptional person whose actions are marvelous; who, with great tenacity and perception, reorders our understanding of the laws of nature.17</p>
<h2 id='graduate-students'>GRADUATE STUDENTS</h2>
<p>During graduate school, the physics students are separated into subfields (solid-state physics, particle physics, plasma physics, astrophysics, and so on). Among the particle physicists, the potential theorists and experimentalists are in the same classes and mingle easily with one another. In the classroom, information is presented both through textbooks, which are essen­ tially didactic, and through reprints of articles (papers or letters from journals). The teacher is a specialist in the subfield; the purpose of discussion continues to be clarification of the tasks to be mastered, rather than interpretation.</p>
<p>In the laboratory graduate students are usually given routine tasks such as dismantling, repairing, and rebuilding a piece of malfunctioning equipment. In effect, the novices are to vali­ date their understanding of the original by making a model of it. In Balinese painting, it is a test</p>
<p>of competence for the artist to produce a uniform background of fine detail; it is only in this context that a dynamic foreground can be seen as significant information, as deliberate and achieved rather than as error: &quot;the function and necessity of the first level control is precisely to make the second level possible.&quot;18 The experimentalist calls this first level of control in physics a &quot;coherent ground state&quot;; students must show that they can comprehend and reproduce chis degree of order.</p>
<p>In generating a coherent ground state, the students also learn how to differentiate between errors and significant deviations in their data, and come to understand the difference between</p>
<p>mediocre and good experimental work. They are learning to become meticulous, patient, and persistent, and that these emotional qualities are crucial for doing good physics. They also are beginning to learn what is meant by &quot;good taste,&quot; &quot;good judgment,&quot; and &quot;creative work&quot; in physics.19 They are receiving training in aesthetic judgments as well as in the emotional responses appropriate to those judgments (catharsis, pride, satisfaction, pleasure).20 They are learning to live and feel physics. Most physicists said that it was in graduate school that they got their first &quot;real feeling for physics.&quot;</p>
<p>During graduate school, the student either chooses or is assigned to an adviser. Typically, this person assumes an avuncular role in the novice&#39;s life.21 No matter how outrageous or dangerous the student&#39;s errors in the laboratory, the adviser is obliged to remain tolerant. Advisers occasion­ ally take their students &quot;for a few beers&quot;; the adviser tells stories and the novices joke with him.22 During laboratory meetings, the students may briefly, teasingly &quot;heckle&quot; the adviser. When the student finishes graduate school, the adviser is expected to make use of his network to find the student a postdoc position. Senior experimentalists often comment on the pervasive impact their advisers had on both their personal and professional lives. Most say that they got their &quot;sense of how to do good physics&quot; from their adviser. In the words of Roland Barthes, &quot;the origin of work is not in the first influence, it is in the first posture: one copies a role, then by meton­ omy, an art; I begin by reproducing the person I wane to be.&quot;23</p>
<p>The laudatory phrases I found most frequently in a group of letters of recommendation for young physicists about to finish graduate school suggest that the ideal student is a &quot;hard and willing worker,&quot; &quot;careful, meticulous, and thorough,&quot; a &quot;good colleague&quot; who always &quot;delivered&quot; and had a good sense of what was possible.24 The   novice is learning by a process of trial, error, and comparison.25</p>
<p>Two of the letters of recommendation mentioned the wife of the candidate, suggesting that she &quot;understood&quot; that it was necessary for an experimentalist to spend many nights with the detector. Anecdotal evidence suggests that high-energy physicists typically marry as graduate students, and rarely divorce. In my discussions with about fifty wives of high-energy physicists almost all were deeply impressed with the value of their husbands&#39; field of work. Several nodded vigorously when one well-educated wife in her late thirties told me she thought it selfish and silly for a high-energy physicist&#39;s wife to pursue her own career. She thought that one could best con­ tribute to society and civilization by providing as much support as possible for the work of people like her husband; very little else could be as important. The older wife of a laboratory director interjected that she thought the way to avoid distracting the husband from his impor­ tant work was to pursue one&#39;s own interests seriously. By their glances at each other I gathered that the younger women disagreed.</p>
<p>In the physics community as a whole, the proportion of wives who strongly oppose making a serious commitment to challenging work of their own is very large. In contrast, the wives of almost all of the most successful senior physicists have developed and maintained strong careers in addition to raising children (I saw men engage in parenting very rarely). This difference may bedue to many factors. I suggest three possibilities: that those physicists destined to become dis­ tinguished are more likely to marry women who will sustain active careers; that the career inter­ ests of wives emerge if their husbands become especially successful, perhaps even as an emblem of that success; or that historical circumstances affect marriage values: chose who married during World War II, for example, may have regarded a woman&#39;s having strong interests of her own as more acceptable than those who married in the 1950s, 1960s, and even the 1970s. Even among</p>
<p>this group, however, the husband&#39;s career in physics had always taken precedence in decisions about where the family should live. I found only three dual-career couples (in which both careers were apparently given equal weight) in my entire research on this community; in two of those three cases both husband and wife were high-energy physicists.</p>
<p>In general, the massive level of support expected by those engaged in scientific research extends not only co the laboratory sea.ff but also to their families.26 The families are part of the culture of high-energy physics and the stages ofa career in physics mold the family, much as one might expect in ocher vocations such as the military, religious groups, and the arts.Those who are not married by the end ofgraduate school or those who are divorced can expect discussion about their personal life to be active and elaborate. I have heard male physicists in the United States, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union, but not Japan, analyze the rumors about the supposed sexual liaisons of unmar­ ried physicists from around the world. Very rarely have I heard male physicists discuss the affairs of their married colleagues. Liaisons are discountenanced as an unworthy distraction ofvital energies; from this commentary graduate students learn that a successful physicist is a married physicist. The mother ofone physicist said that her son had cold her he planned co marry because hedid not want to bother with a social life chat would &quot;distract from his work.&quot;</p>
<p>Graduate students also learn stories about male scientists going to extraordinary lengths to</p>
<p>get, record, and save data. One story concerns the bubble chamber at the now-defunct Cam­ bridge Electron Accelerator (CEA). Bubble chambers have very sensitive and very powerful pres­ surization systems. As the perhaps apocryphal story goes, one night one of the propane tanks exploded, practically blowing the students out of the lab; they could have been killed. One real­ ized he was going to lose the data for his thesis and ran back in to gee ic; che second explosion blew him out the door again, data in hand.</p>
<p>These stories follow the literary form not of romance but of high mimesis: the hero is &quot;supe­ rior in degree to others, but not to the environment&quot;; he is a powerful leader who is subject co the highly consistent order of nature, not a remaker of it. Whereas the romantic hero is secure in his place in the pantheon, the lesser hero of high mimesis may fall. If the story is a tragedy, his fall does not call heroism or the hero into question: he is then a &quot;strong character in a weak situ­</p>
<p>ation.&quot;27 The emotions typically generated by the high-mimetic form are pity and fear; the form emerges historically at a time when an &quot;aristocracy is fast losing its effective power, but retaining a good deal of effective prestige.&quot;28 The novice physicists, about co escape the power of their rexes and teachers, have already begun co draw their heroes from their own kind.</p>
<h2 id='postdoctoral-physicists'>POSTDOCTORAL PHYSICISTS</h2>
<p>Thepostdoctoral period, which can itself lase as much as six years, concludes the long appren­ ticeship. Young physicists will be evaluated during this postdoctoral period to determine who will be invited co join the particle physics core community, who will become a member of one of</p>
<p>the peripheral groups, and who will leave the field. The core community is composed of the researchers ac the major laboratories and the university physics departments whose faculties include several high-energy physicists doing research at the major laboratories. Peripheral co chem are the so-called facilities groups at the major labs, which maintain the research equip­ ment, and physics faculties at lesser universities. Those who leave the field usually move into computer science, astrophysics, biophysics, or geophysics.</p>
<p>From the Ph.D. stage on, the successful theorists and experimentalists separate.The theorists join Theory Groups and the experimentalists join Research Groups. The experimentalist post­ docs are expected to acquire and exhibit skills in detector design and construction, the design of experiments, and data analysis. Ideally, one should become equally adept at all three; at least one should not reveal a strong distaste for, or incompetence in, any of them. Versatility is important: it is not good to be identified as either a &quot;desk&quot; physicist or a &quot;floor&quot; physicist.</p>
<p>Postdocs are no longer students but young physicists; as such they must learn how to rely on oral rather than written information. They are expected to begin to move beyond the textbook and literature phase of their training, to scan written material primarily to find out who to talk to. Postdocs also learn about the past, conveyed to them in various oral traditions quite distinct from the history of science they were taught to avoid as undergraduates.They learn chat what is current has an expected lifetime of about six months. From tales about earlier vicissitudes of their detector, and the exploits of their group leader in younger days, they learn the lore of local nostalgia.29 Every troublesome detail is remembered; the detector itself is a mnemonic device. A detector in disuse teaches the fear of che obsolete. Postdocs learn that the living past is shallow; genesis, it is agreed, was about seventy-five years ago; genealogies of their teachers can be traced back around forty years (at least for the most notable scientists). Their broader knowledge of the past extends only to the depth of their own generation. The only ones to bother with the past are either old physicists, who no longer &quot;have any physics left in them,&quot; or professional historians of science, who presumably &quot;couldn&#39;t make it&quot; as physicists.</p>
<p>Some of the postdocs see oral communications as a subtle tool. A European postdoc at SLAC observed to me that many American postdocs simply don&#39;t ask questions-they seem to feel that they might come across as uninformed or even stupid if they did. Another, a non-American and one of the few women in the community-she lacer left the field-found all this hesitation silly and asked many questions; she says chat others privately thanked her for doing so. Yet another postdoc suggested that it was difficult to trust anything one heard because everyone was trying co impress the others by sounding off; he thought it best to learn on one&#39;s own.</p>
<p>By now the senior physicists expect the research associates to be able to do exacting work carefully, cautiously, and with persistence. Almost all postdocs cell stories of how they produced some unexpectedly essential piece of equipment or software for their research groups at the cost of an enormous amount of tedious labor in the face of serious and very complex-but ultimately uninteresting 0bscacles. They usually feel that their product was hastily and greedily incorpo­</p>
<p>rated by the group, with little if any acknowledgment or appreciation. They no longer get the recognition they got as graduate students for doing such casks well. Skill is taken for granted. Stories about this are told with either wry amusement or bitterness. Senior physicists will only say that postdocs must learn co live with such situations.30</p>
<p>Independent, risky work can be undertaken only if the postdoc succeeds in gaining sole responsibility for some project, a privilege not readily granted. This opportunity is won by dis­ playing a convincing faith in one&#39;s own powers to do a task better than others in the allotted time and within the budget, no matter what the obstacles. This self-assertion and bravado is in part a matter of disdaining the work of others; it is necessary to show chat one can and will expose mediocre work, no matter who has done it. In America postdocs learn the appropriate ways to call attention to themselves and away from their peers, and how co call upon senior group mem­ bers to act as their advocates. A poscdoc is expected to display drive, commitment, and charisma. The desired presentation of self can be characterized as competitive, haughty, and superfi-</p>
<p>cially nonconformist. Two prominent senior physicists joked that one should &quot;behave British and think Yiddish, but not the ocher way around.&quot; One group leader said chat to convince och­ ers of the validity of one&#39;s work one had to have great confidence and be very &quot;aggressive&quot;; he added chat one needed a certain &quot;son-of-a-bitchness.&quot; An employee at $LAC who finds the habits of the physicists very interesting said chat in his twenty years of watching chem he had concluded chat only the &quot;blunt, bright bastards&quot; make it, and pointed out  the young physicists at the lab who in his view were clearly &quot;too nice&quot; to become successful. Letters of recommenda­ tion for applicants to the postdoc positions often say chat even though the candidate is quiet and mild-mannered, s/he does excellent physics; in ocher words, those are qualities for which a can­ didate muse compensate. Achieving the appropriate ethos can be quite stressful, and chis is com­ mented upon by many postdocs. Those unwilling or unable to develop chis personal style are not likely to be recognized as serious physicists committed to their work.</p>
<p>In sum, senior physicists in American labs assume that good physics judgment is associated with independence, and they cultivate chis trait in their postdocs by erecting barriers to it. This situation demands a &quot;careful form of insubordination&quot;31 on the part of the postdoc: they respect the tacit instructions of their elders by not following their explicit instructions, and this must be done with considerable delicacy.</p>
<p>The postdoc situation is usually described by senior scientists, at any rate in public, rather differently. Paul Berg, in an interview at the time of his 1980 Nobel prize in chemistry, com­ mented on how his students and research associates were building their careers by working in his lab:</p>
<p>My work has been built on the work of many other people, and without the people who worked with me-the pose-does and students-we could never have done what we did.</p>
<p>In fact, many of the useful ideas came from students, while I was away.</p>
<p>When the head of a team like mine gets recognition, everybody in the lab knows that the credit is shared among many. I have not done any research work with my hands for five years. The work may have been initiated or guided by me, but much of the work has been done by srudencs <em>who are building their careers.</em></p>
<p>We work as a unit. Very often we cannot identify the origin of an idea. It will have been adapted and</p>
<p>modified and changed so often, then it leads to something else, and finally there is a break-through.32</p>
<p>The discrepancy between the official description of group work as cooperative and the per­ sistent, disguised message that only competition and transgression will prevail secs up a &quot;double bind.&quot; Gregory Bateson, the creator of the double bind theory, says of this kind of behavior: &quot;First, ... severe pain and maladjustment can be induced by putting [one] in the wrong regard­ ing [the] rules for making sense of an important relationship with another....And second, ...  if this pathology can be warded off or resisted, the total experience may promote creativicy.&quot;33</p>
<p>Postdocs who discover chis double bind too late become angry at what they consider a decep­ tion. One group leader implied chat those who complain would not have made it anyway when he said that &quot;the unhappy RAs [postdoctoral research associates] are not the RAs we wane.&quot;</p>
<p>Two older physicists endorse chis ordeal in other terms: &quot;Some do what they say they will do, no matter what; ochers give you lots of excuses about why it&#39;s not possible.&quot; &quot;Ordinary ones keep cycling through the same mistakes; good ones become contributors.&quot;</p>
<p>There are many stories among postdocs about &quot;making it big,&quot; making a major contribution to the group and assuring one&#39;s future. As one postdoc says: &quot;There are three kinds of experi­ mentalists: the top five percent, the next fifty percent, and the others. The top ones, noquestion,</p>
<p>they&#39;re good. The next fifty; they are very bright, but they need luck and judgment and good opportunities co make it big. And politics. The others don&#39;t make it.&quot;</p>
<p>A European postdoc said that the Americans are terribly competitive: &quot;They are all trying to</p>
<p>make a name for themselves, selling ideas and hiding ideas. They&#39;re all looking for their own pri­ vate quark.&quot; An Asian postdoc who had been educated in the United States said: &quot;People are tense and anxious; it is hard to work with chem. Everyone is looking for some way to make themselves look better, co make the ocher guy look worse.&quot;</p>
<p>Another postdoc knows that he has not &quot;made it,&quot; and he is angry. Reexamining his postdoc­ torace, he believes that he now understands why he failed. In the first year, he thinks, the senior experimentalists are scanning the postdocs to see who is &quot;charismatic.&quot; They watch how the postdocs handle conversations; the preferred style is confident, aggressive, and even abrasive if one suspects chat another&#39;s ideas are wrong; he feels he could have adopted this style if he had understood its importance. The next step would have been to seek out &quot;an action seccor&quot;-an exciting, volatile, and fashionable area. At that point in his own career, &quot;charm&quot; became fashion­ able. He feels he ought co have taught himself and then taught others about &quot;charm.&quot; He should have anticipated where the problems lay and cultivated connections accordingly. The next step would have been to gain responsibility for some large, important project-so important chat others would have sought him out to talk. Ideally, he should have proposed an experiment of his own. Instead, out ·ofloyalty and commitment, he stuck with his assigned task. Now he feels chis cost him his career in high-energy physics. He believes that he would have had difficulty being granted these responsibilities, however; he sees himself as being outside the &quot;old boys&#39; club,&quot; because in the labs where he did graduate work his undergraduate school was not considered to be &quot;on the map.&quot; This postdoc has come to these conclusions retroactively; he is comparing his career over the past several years with those of his peers who have made it. He has since left high­ energy physics.</p>
<p>The graduate student&#39;s fear settles into the misery of the postdoc double bind; that misery pushes a few past their fear into a bravura performance and success. A senior experimentalist told me chat someone with experience can judge new postdocs within a few days of their arrival at the laboratory. Senior physicists believe that it is not necessary to scan the hinterlands for ini­ tiates; they are sure that the exceptional candidates will eventually be brought co their attention,</p>
<p>whether they come from Caltech and Tokyo University or from the universities of Alaska and Hokkaido. As the Americans say, &quot;If they are good, they will get here.&quot;</p>
<p>The physicists see themselves as an elite whose membership is determined solely by scientific merit.34 The assumption is that everyone has a fair start. This is underscored by the rigorously informal dress code, the similarity of their offices, and the &quot;first naming&quot; practiced in the com­ munity. Competitive individualism is considered both just and effective:35 the hierarchy is seen as a meritocracy which produces fine physics.</p>
<p>This composite account of the postdoc&#39;s fortunes takes the literary form of low mimesis: the suffering hero strives for advancement, which is blocked by seemingly intractable obstacles; the obstacles are finally overcome by an opportunistic and vigorous response to unforeseen circum­ stances. While such &quot;heroes&quot; can inspire sympathy or scorn, we are not inclined to see them as superior beings, much less as superhuman,36 a key difference between hero-scientists of the past and of the present.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, to be fully conscious of the social and psychological forces at work in this post­ doctoral phase would be debilitating for the candidate, according co chis community&#39;s values.</p>
<p>&quot;Unconscious&quot; in this community means arbitrary and unknowable, and hence uninteresting. Concern with these and related matters, such as how to get along with other people, is consid­ ered somewhat unscientist-like. Social eccentricity and childlike egoism are cultivated displays of commitment to rationality, objectivity, and science. Young scientists often assert their igno­ rance of human motives, of everything &quot;subjective,&quot; as if that confirms their vocation.37 Devel­</p>
<p>opment of insight into one&#39;s own motives and actions is thought to be a diversion of time and attention better spent on science. One experimentalist has cold me that he believed a successful postdoc had to be rather immature: a mature person would have too much difficulty accepting the training without question and limiting doubts to a prescribed sphere. He felt that this pre­ condition kept most women and minorities from doing well: their social experience had taught chem to doubt authority only too thoroughly.</p>
<p>At the end of their fifteen-year training period young particle physicists hope to become full members of the research community. However, only about a fourth of the American students will be sponsored for positions at major universities or laboratories where they will be able to continue research. Those remaining have three options, which like the less successful Ph.D.&#39;s they take in approximately equal numbers: they can leave the field, or work at peripheral schools and cease research, or take a staff position at a major lab in which they&quot;will manage the produc­ tion and maintenance of detectors (what one group leader calls &quot;engineering management&quot;). During their postdoctoral assignments the young physicists have learned the meaning of these four kinds of careers, as seen by the group leaders, and most have come to believe that this rank­ ing correlates with personal ability. They know that their group leaders&#39; evaluation of chem is critical for their futures; they usually believe in its justice.</p>
<p>There are a very limited number of laboratories and universities &quot;on the map&quot; in physics. The novice physicist can learn the names of these &quot;holy places&quot; in physics simply by noting the places mentioned in the biographies of the great physicists located in the margins of the under­ graduate textbook. As in the rest of academia and other preindustrial institutions, such as the Catholic church and the military, they are trained at the &quot;core&quot; and then move to the periphery. Clear boundary markers define the community by defining specifically <em>both</em> what the group wishes to include <em>and</em> what it excludes. In the analytic language developed by Gregory Bateson, the matter in the textbook margins serves as &quot;context markers&quot;-signs chat operate at a &quot;higher logical type&quot; than the (social) text-indicating to those who know the cultural clues in the con­ text markers how to read the messages in the (social) text.38 In other words, the immortal heroes of science in the margins of the undergraduate physics textbook define the posture one must dis­</p>
<p>play and the genealogy one must acquire.</p>
<p>To become a designer of machines one must survive all these exclusionary cuts, show oneself to be &quot;part of the signal, not part of the background noise.&quot; In their struggle for survival novices learn about time. During the undergraduate years, students discover the insignificance of the past in high-energy physics while simultaneously learning to see the heroes of the past as inacces­ sibly great. Interest in the formal history of the field, full as it is of outmoded or erroneous ideas, is considered debilitating. Study of the history of physics is condensed into the generic celebra­ tion of timeless genius and &quot;reproducing&quot; the successful experiments under descriptions chat assimilate chem to current knowledge. Graduate students learn to fear losing data by accidental erasure of computer records or failure of detectors during an experiment, which results in a loss of beamtime and hence a lower production of data. Less data means a lower-quality thesis, which means less opportunity for a good postdoc position. Postdoctoral research associates,</p>
<p>from stories about chose who have made ic, realize how important it is co anticipate future new directions in theory and new solutions co the design problems of detectors. In order to be suc­ cessful, they must privately figure out the future of physics. When the novices become members of an experimental research group, they begin o identify their own careers with that of a detec­ tor. After their ten years of training, they now have about ten more years co make their reputa­ tions in che field. le is as new group members chat the young physicists learn the significance of the lifetimes of detectors, research groups, laboratories, careers, and ideas. Fear of obsolescence in these five areas leads co a recognition chat uptime, downtime, and bearnc.ime are scarce com­ modities co be acquired and used in che contest for power.</p>
<p><strong>GROUP LEADER</strong></p>
<p>During his career, a group leader accumulates considerable wealth in the form of detectors, tar­ gets, and computer software, as well as his less tangible-but perhaps even more significant­ reputation in the community. (In Japan this wealth is controlled by che entire <em>koza:</em> the full professor, the associate professors, and the assistant professors.) That reputation is the power that the leader wields in the community as awhole; it is symbolized by his membership on labo­ ratory program advisory committees, which determine which experiments will be accepted, and by his control of a network cutting across laboratories and physics departments around the world. This wealth must be maintained assiduously; it is not clear that it can be inherited. Every powerful senior physicist can invoke a lineage of which he is a part, naming his teacher and his teacher&#39;s teacher. It is direct descent from one leader co another in this lineage and the attendant privileges, rights, and duties that a leader will try to bequeath to one of the poscdocs who have worked with him. The generations are about fifteen years apart, which means that a group leader would be choosing among approximately twenty-five postdocs for his presumptive heir.39 But if the group leader began co assert his influence on behalf of a successor, the other group leaders would begin to resist it. It might appear that a group leader could gain concessions and establish his heir, but in trying to do so he would have to spend some of his wealth-thereby weakening his own position, leaving him little to bequeath. Nevertheless, they try. During the old days of funding expansion they could start new groups for their heirs. Now the only group their heirs might lead is their own. Just as chis generation&#39;s leaders&#39; power reaches its zenith, their capacity for naming the next generation&#39;s leaders is lost because of declines in funding.</p>
<p>Among the five to ten poscdocs the group leader actively supports during their careers at other departments and laboratories, one or two usually have che ambition co achieve the stature of group leader. These postdocs feel that it is better for their careers in the long range to move outside their leader&#39;s immediate circle. If he is able to establish himself, usually with the contin­ ued implicit support of the group leader, the young physicist will be extending the group leader&#39;s reputation, influence, and network, not depleting it. The leader and protege will help each other in building and maintaining domains in their respective generations.</p>
<p>The senior physicists feel that they share a strong commitment to physics; they fear that the younger physicists only came into the field for the glamour and excitement. Some are pleased that biology has become fashionable, because the students who follow fashion will not be in physics. Nevertheless, some physicists are very concerned about so many physics students switching to biology.40 I listened to one professor at a midwestern university explain for nearly</p>
<p>an hour to a student that while the financial opportunities were greater in biology, the &quot;real sci­ ence&quot; always has been in physics.</p>
<p>The second problem, according to the senior physicists, is that funding for particle physics began to diminish around 1970. (Actually only the race of increase has declined.) They charac­ terize their field until that time as having &quot;grown exponentially.&quot;41They mean that a sufficiently talented graduate could have expected before 1970 to spend five years in graduate school, five years as a postdoc, five years in a research group, and then to become a group leader. They realize that this is no longer possible.</p>
<p>The Americans believe that these two problems-the decline in quality of students and in quantity of funding-are due to forces outside the particle physics community.  Nevertheless, they are compelled to cope with the consequences, obliged to spend what they consider an inor­ dinate amount of time attending co the next generation, both in restricting entry into the field and in getting favored candidates established with research groups of their own.</p>
<p>Full-fledged physicists in America typically tell stories about howgood their own work is and how inadequate the work of others in their generation is. For example, one physicist at SLAC said co me that &quot;there is no one &#39;in-house&#39; at Fermilab who can tie his shoes experimentally.&quot; Another physicist said chat some well-known experimentalists are consistently wrong, and chat their careers are founded only on their personalities. He mentioned a &quot;personal project&quot; of his; over the years he had followed the career of a colleague internationally known as a &quot;brilliant ideas man&quot; and checked out where this man&#39;s ideas actually came from. In talking with col­ leagues across the country, he had yet to find that even one idea had been original. He added that he had found that <em>one</em> experimentalist in the field was consistently right: a Nobel prize winner who &quot;never has an original idea&quot; but who specializes in &quot;shooting down spectacular experi­ ments.&quot; He went on to say that this man has organized a group of devoted, willing workers, whom he works very hard, and has built a standard detector very meticulously. If his experi­ ments corroborate the &quot;spectacular experiment,&quot; his team&#39;s work is regarded as the proof; if they contradict it, then his group gains credit for exposing error. I have been cold many stories during my fieldwork by several senior physicists about chis man&#39;s supposedly egocentric, authoritarian manner and his unimaginative physics.</p>
<p>In ironic reversal of the graduate student&#39;s stories about the fear of losing data, the anxi­</p>
<p>eties of the permanent group member are about having data that no one will notice, about everyone paying attention to someone else&#39;s data. The end of an active experimental career in physics occurs at about fifty. It is considered inappropriate for someone over fifty co be making discoveries.</p>
<p>The senior physicists are convinced chat the successes of their own generation were based on brash, youthful intelligence, independence, and competition. They wonder if there was some­ thing distinctive about their generation, the people who graduated at the end of World War II, but in general they are inclined to believe that the current young generation is not of the same quality as the physicists of the previous fifty or sixty years.</p>
<p>An undergraduate learns to focus on the present, a graduate student discovers that there is not enough time in the present. Postdocs should learn that the future is too short, that they have to anticipate it in order to have enough time. Full-fledged physicists worry about apportioning time between doing physics and going &quot;on the circuit.&quot; Senior physicists know that what one needs to be concerned about is obsolescence. Whether for the laboratory, one&#39;s detector, one&#39;s career, or even one&#39;s own ideas, time is running out again, as for the graduate students, but now</p>
<p>it is another kind of rime. What sen_ior figures need to do before their accomplishments become seen as the last generation&#39;s, rather than the lase year&#39;s, is co make a transition into being one of the statesmen of che field.</p>
<h1 id='statesmen--in\tphysics'><strong>STATESMEN  IN	PHYSICS</strong></h1>
<p>The first srage in becoming a science statesman is administering a laboratory. Each laboratory is thought by physicists co reflect the necessarily powerful personality of its director. Accelerators come into being because of the vision, creativity, and tenacity of an individual who can gather about him a ream of gifted people whose work he directs and coordinates by means of his exam­ p.le, will, and-some would say-whim. In the United States, rule  through a formal  organiza­ tion structure is considered bad for physics.</p>
<p>When I ask these statesmen if rhey still think about experiments, they say, &quot;Well, I&#39;m really coo busy for that sort of thing, I don&#39;t have time. Of course, I&#39;m interested, I keep up with things, go to conferences.&quot; Often ar the very top conferences a lot of senior people sit around in their shire sleeves, clearly enjoying the debate, but they are not the speakers, usually. Thar would be inappropriate.</p>
<p>Statesmen no longer actually do physics; rhey recruit students. They gee money for the lab; they get money for science, they attend to the public understanding of science. It is utterly inap­ propriate for junior persons co be doing any of these things. Only a senior person can do this. Furthermore, only a senior person who has made a significant discovery can do it, one who has manifestly been able to avoid for an entire career the corrupting enticements of extrascientific power. On the other hand, interacting with people outside is itself a kind of corruption.</p>
<p>Teaching, administration, and consulting for the government are potentially contaminating because they require the cultivation of skills not  thought to be based on  reason-in particular, the power of persuasion. The scientists themselves usually claim that they no longer do research because they have no time; other scientists believe char these science-statesmen chose their new role because they no longer had &quot;any science left in them.&quot; These statesmen regularly transgress the boundary between the domain of rational laws of science and the arbitrary laws of humanity, bur nor wirh impunity. As emissaries co the world of the merely human, they are disbarred from practicing science. In a final twist of irony, they take their place in the margins of the textbooks of undergraduate physics students, heroically guarding rhe boundaries of physics.</p>
<h2 id='geniuses'>GENIUSES</h2>
<p>Thetextbook I reviewed at the beginning of this chapter emphasized the gap between the read­ ing student and the very distant geniuses of science. The second story, about the exploding labo­ ratory, suddenly situated the graduate student novice in physics as hero, gallantly rescuing data for science. The poscdoc&#39;s story was about commitment, about tenacity in the face of nearly insurmountable obstacles, and about the courage to gamble, and the story of the group leader says char by the end of an exemplary career a good scientist is a negotiator, a ralent broker, and a fundraiser. Finally, the scientist may become the subject of textbook stories, a genius of science held in awe by those reading their first stories in science. Those stories of timeless genius regen-</p>
<p>crate the romance of science. Eminent scientists also generate their own stories about their dis­ coveries. I quote from one of those autobiographical accounts in a Nobel lecture:</p>
<p>That was the beginning, and che idea seemed so obvious co me and so elegant that I fell deeply in love with ir. And, like falling in love with a woman, it is only possible if you do not know much about her, so you cannot see her faults. The faults will become apparent lacer, but after the love is strong enough to hold you ro her. So, I was held to chis theory, in spice of all difficulties, by my youthful enthusiasm So what</p>
<p>happened to the old theory that I fell in love with as a youth? Well, I would say it&#39;s become an old lady, who has very liccle that&#39;s anracrive left in her, and the young today will not have their hearts pound when they look at her anymore. But, we can say the best we can for any old woman, char she has been a very good mother and has given birch co some very good children. And I thank che Swedish Academy of Sci­ ences for complimenting one of them. Thank you.42</p>
<p>Another Nobel laureate concluded a brief scientific autobiography by explaining his feelings for the object of his prize-winning studies: &quot;Writing this brief biography has made me realize what a long love affair I have had with the electron. Like most love affairs, ir has had its ups and downs, but for me the joys have far outweighed the frustrations.&quot;43 Such stories express rhe sci­ entists&#39; deep desire for knowing about nature and their deep desire for acquiring data. At the same time, they also point to what these physicists feel about knowing and chink about loving.44 In these autobiographical statements nature and ideas about nature are coalesced, anthropo­ morphized into a singular female love object. The image of real female human beings held by almost all these male scientists is chat women are more passive, less aggressive than men. This socially constructed gender difference is used by many scientists to define the relation between themselves and their love object. The scientist is persistent, dominant, and aggressive, ultimately penetrating the corpus of secrets mysteriously concealed by a passive, albeit elusive nature. The</p>
<p>female exists in these stories only as an object for a man to love, unveil, and know.</p>
<p>In their careers, physicists journey from romantic readings of others&#39; lives, through handing on mimetic tales of heroic action and quests for survival, to becoming skilled practitioners of gossip and rhetoric. They complete the circle by telling erotic tales about physics, tales trans­ formed into romance for the next generation of neophytes. These stories reflect how physicists come to care passionately about who they are and what they are doing. Together they form a picaresque cycle, which chronicles a journey that begins necessarily with innocence and reports its loss; it depicts the growth of strength and the pain of betrayal, hails the achievement of suc­</p>
<p>cess, recognizes the signs of grace in eminent discoveries, looks back in erotic nostalgia, and lastly eulogizes the heroic dead.45 In Western culture the picaresque genre is usually reserved for stories about men, not women: women are not seen as gaining strength and wisdom through the rambunctious loss of their &quot;innocence.&quot; The very form of these exemplary tales excludes women</p>
<p>as their proper subject.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting that only biological males can participate in the cycle. I am claiming char in chis cycle a certain cluster of characteristics is associated with success, a cluster that is part or our culture&#39;s social construction of male gender.46 These stories about a life in physics define virtue as independence in defining goals, deliberate and shrewd cultivation of varied experience, and fierce competition with peers in the race for discoveries. Independence, experience, compe­ tition, and individual victories are strongly associated with male socialization in our culture. By contrast, recent studies in Japan suggest that these are the qualities associated with professionally active women, not men. Women are seen as not sufficiently schooled in the masculine virtues of interdependence, in the effective organization of teamwork and camaraderie, commitment to</p>
<p>working in one team in order to complete a complex task successfully and consulting with group members in decision making, and the capacity to nurture the newer group members in develop­ ing these skills. It would appear chat there is nothing consistent cross-culturally in the content of the virtues associated with success. We do see that the virtues of success, whatever their content, are associated with men.</p>
<p>By examining affect and gender in the stories physicists tell I am exploring part of a larger tale. The informal stories people cell in the laboratory can give us a special perspective on the dominant models of success and failure in a community; chose models are not gender-free in form or content. Affect and gender are significant components in the division oflabor in labora­ tory research, as well as in decision-making, dispute-making, and leadership styles chat are part of the whole realm of power and tradition in scientific research. My purpose is not to make a psychological expose, but to clarify the patterns in everyday laboratory practices.</p>

<li>By referring co this relationship as avuncular, I am invoking the anthropological notion of the &quot;avunculace&quot;: &quot;the right and duties the maternal uncle has coward his sisters&#39; sons and his power over them,&quot; together with the infor­ mal and ritual behavior appropriate to that relationship.

<li>Thesample included approximately thirty letters of recommendation written co one group leader, in which I noted ninery-rwo qualitative, evaluative remarks, five of which I saw repeated in at least ten letters, and rwo were repeated six times: good judgment (10); careful, meticulous, thorough (13); delivered (10); hard and willing worker (16); good colleague (11); good physicist (10); independent (6); intelligent (6). One was called original, two were said to be able co express themselves cogently, and two were identified as ready for the responsibility to organize a project.</li>

<li>Nostalgia <strong>is a</strong> form ofhiscorical consciousness. According to Dean MacCannell, <em>The Tourist: A New Theory of the Leimre Class</em> (New York: Schocken Books, 1976), p. 3, nostalgia is a key component in the ethos of progress: &quot;The progress of modernity ... depends on irs very sense of instability and inauthenticity. For moderns, reality and authen­ ticity are thought to be elsewhere: in other historical periods and other cultures, in purer, simpler lifestyles. In other words, the concern of moderns for &#39;naturalness,&#39; their nostalgia and their search for authenticity are not merely casual and somewhat decadent, though harmless, arrachmenrs to the souvenirs of destroyed cultures and dead epoch.s. They are also components of the conquering spirit of modernity-the grounds of irs unifying consciousness.&quot; Paul Fussell, <em>The Great War in Modern Memory</em> (London: Ox.ford University Press, 1975), has argued that individual memories of the past are shaped by socially constructed, collective narratives which need have licde relationship to the once lived experience. The narratives about detectors are success stories.</li>
