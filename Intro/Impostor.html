<p><strong>Abstract</strong> </p>
<p>This is an attempt to insert  the stories  we tell about fear and shame into a history  of twentieth - century psychology  and its obsession with achievement and modernization. It is an attempt to write an affective history of achievement at the turn of the millennium - and to make this feeling history.  Impostor  Syndrome  is  a  pop-psychological  diagnosis,  employed  to  explain  the  low presence  of  women  in  STEM  fields,  business  and  academic  administration  and  ’thought leadership’  in the pubic sphere. The article  follows the intellectual lineage of two precursors of Impostor Syndrome, Fear of Success and the Impostor Phenomenon. It argues that  the grouping of gender/ race/ success/ affect was a keystone of twentieth-century American psychology and development theory. The history  of this feeling has consequences for thinking about situated knowledge, realism and epistemic justice. </p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong> </p>
<p>In its 1971 inaugural issue,  <em>Ms.</em> magazine* interviewed a young Harvard professor of psychology named Matina Horner. She described this nightmare: </p>
<p>Look, when I was up  for my prelims, I went into a state of anxiety like nothing  I’d ever known before. I carried on so I frightened my husband  and finally, in desperation, he yelled  at me: “For God’s sake, maybe women shouldn’t be in graduate school!” Now, what was I afraid of? I had designed my own prelim, I knew everything I was responsible for. There wasn’t the remotest possibility  of failure; and yet, I was shaking, throwing up, screaming I was stupid and now they’d all know I was stupid (quoted in Gornick 1971, 52). <img src="Aspose.Words.b5c7a587-704a-4e44-840b-92bfd037fefa.001.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>

<p>Horner dedicated her research career to what she called the Fear of Success. Today’s popular literature labels such a feeling “Impostor Syndrome.” This feeling is mobilized to explain the low presence of women in STEM fields, corporate boards, academic administration and “thought leadership” in the public sphere. </p>
<p>A  pop-psychological  diagnostic,  a  label—Impostor  Syndrome—opens  an  entryway  to history. Impostor Syndrome points to a feeling—or rather a cluster of associated names, concepts, practices and affects—that has a history. A history of diagnoses and prescriptions, surveys and clinical reports, biographies and myths. This article is an attempt to insert the stories we tell about  fear  and  shame  into  a  history  of  twentieth-century  psychology  and  its  obsession  with achievement and modernization. It is an attempt to write an affective history of achievement at the turn of the millennium. </p>
<p>I begin this history from the standpoint of embodied experience, with the dangers of blindness, presentism and narcissism it comports. A couple of years ago I read an article about Impostor Syndrome in <em>Slate</em> magazine and saw myself reflected in it: Winona Ryder has it too? Maria Klawe, President of Harvey Mudd College? Margaret Chan, Director of the WHO? Really? This standpoint poses a problematic I cannot easily escape: despite subscription to feminist social theory and a critical understanding of the production of knowledge, a fear persists. Even a terror. This calls for explanation. </p>
<p>The Impostor Syndrome struck a nerve. Perhaps because it described an interpretive, affective gap between my cultural work, my projections onto others, and my internal sense of self. Impostor Syndrome put words—a diagnosis—to my recurrent feelings of failing and faking. Although I never expected to use this phrase in academic writing and likely would recoil if I ever read it, the Impostor Syndrome felt real. </p>
<p>What feels real to me in this story? The affects of early childhood formation, my feelings as a daughter and as a mother and the unfolding from child to adult. I admit that I identify with the psychological type of the Impostor Syndrome: a girl marked at an early age for success and frustrated that it hasn’t all gone as smoothly as promised. From a very early age my mother established as fact that a PhD would be required to successfully navigate a sexist world. All of the exclusions and differences that went into such marking and making reinforce my certainty that my social position is a pure function of luck. I wonder if my self is in fact false, and what that means. Psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott’s phrase, “the annihilation of the self” feels like perhaps the only adequate description of the terror connected to self-exposure in cultural productions (Winnicott 1965, 143). A terror—completely out of measure with any objective uncertainty or menace—that feels very unfortunately real. </p>
<p>When  I  presented  an  early  version  of  this  work  to  an  academic  colloquium,  one questioner became very upset with my treatment of the true and the false. On what grounds, he asked, did I reject the methodology of achievement psychology while seeming to cling to the truth value of psychoanalytic theory? On what grounds did I distinguish truth and falsehood? What was my principle of realism? I could only answer with an affect: I am anxious about this question. This work is a reflection of and on that anxiety. </p>
<p>Other participants at the same colloquium expressed concerns around a similar theme: am I trying to debunk the Impostor Syndrome? Am I questioning the validity of this experience and  this  self-diagnosis?  Does  calling  out  the  history  of  Impostor  Syndrome  just  add  another delusion to expose?  Does this project help or hinder those of us struggling to manage our affects in a high achievement world? </p>
<p>I  wonder  why  the  reality  of  feeling  became  a  central  problem  for  me,  for  the psychologists in this story, for my audience. Why is the question of realism still loaded with affect, long after the old battles of the social constructivists and realists have lost purchase and urgency? This seems to me another way of posing the central concern of this project: the fear and anxiety that come with announcing partial truths, situated knowledges. The shame, which goes with  projecting  one’s  self  into  a  cultural  sphere.  The  suspicion  that  what  I  know  and  make, because it is as small and partial as I am myself, is false or fraudulent.  </p>
<p>Perhaps  the  strength  of  terror  is  a  sign  of  the  stakes  involved.  It  is  telling  us  that knowledge making is a serious game. We are responsible to the people and things of knowledge, to truth, justice and saying the right words at the right time. The history of this feeling has consequences for thinking about situated knowledge, realism and epistemic justice. </p>
<p>The history of Impostor Syndrome is a history of experts who claim to expose the truths behind false feelings and appearances. I do not wish to replicate this act of exposure with yet another flavor of revelation, the historical genealogy. So goes the promise of revelation: if only you knew </p>
<p>what lay behind your impostor feelings, these fears would melt away under the light of truth. Once you read this article, the Impostor Syndrome will appear a mere historical construct and its affective power will deflate. Somehow I don’t see this happening. As Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick (2002) says, the promise of exposure has been oversold. </p>
<p>To expose what is “really behind” Impostor Syndrome, to reveal its historical dark side, seems insufficient and unsatisfying. It does not seem enough to show that Impostor Syndrome has some sexist, racist, imperialist roots. As Sedgwick suggests, a paranoid stance often forecloses more than it opens. Paranoid people are never surprised; it’s always as bad as they had expected (Sedgwick 2002, 90). </p>
<p>Instead of a paranoid history, this is an attempt at a reparative history. What would it mean to repair this story, to make a reparative history? Repair tends to revolve around a desire to heal the self through the care of others. This article on Impostor Syndrome certainly started that way. </p>
<p>A reparative history might name the inheritances of the Cold War military-industrial - academic  infrastructure,  of  technocratic  feminism,  of  motivation  psychology,  of  slavery,  as constitutive of me, the situated twenty-first-century white woman American academic. I work at a public institution whose leaders tout its diversity. I am emotionally and professionally invested </p>
<p>in a certain optimism around social mobility through academic achievement. Yet queer people and people of color on campus, among others, live through forms of precarity that challenge the institution  and  its  diversity  optimisms  (Ahmed  2012).   I  am  shaped  by  these  achievement - oriented  worlds,  of  which  I  am  a  product  and  an  agent.  They  may  produce  anguish  and discomfort  but  I  live  in  the  discomfort,  attend  to  it.  I  recognize  the  power  of  motivation </p>
<p>psychology and therapeutic attempts to foster fearlessness and self-affirmation. I am not innocent in this process. I cannot walk away from the rubbish pile. I wonder whether repair, recycling and reassembly are viable alternatives. </p>
<p>I  am  inspired  by  Nicolas  Long  and  Henrietta  Moore’s  theoretically  generous  and ethnographically situated approach to the social life of achievement: “An enquiry into the social life of achievement… demands that we interrogate the factors and processes that underpin the specific  ways  in  which  achievement  has  become  an  aspect  of  particular  human  subjects’ imaginative and fantasmic engagements with self and others”(Long and Moore 2013, 5). I like that  Long  and  Moore  engage  with  fantasy  and  feeling  at  specific  sites  of  engagement.  Their phrasing, which gives emotion a social life, rings true. Above all their formulation offers the possibility  of  an  open  engagement  with  the  misogyny,  racism  and  imperialism  inherent  in modernizing affects. </p>
<p><strong>Need for Achievement</strong> </p>
<p>Why did women’s feelings about achievement appear in the 1960s and 1970s to Matina Horner, <em>Ms.</em> magazine and many others as a pressing problem to solve? Why did the entanglement of gender, success and affect present a knot needing to be unraveled? Horner’s Fear of Success offered  answers  to  a  problem  formulated  by  psychologists  two  generations  earlier  (Horner </p>
<p>1973b). In following Horner’s intellectual lineage we perceive that the grouping of gender/ race/ success/  affect  was  a  keystone  of  twentieth-century  American  psychology  and  development theory.  </p>
<p>In  1971,  two  years  before  Horner  was  named  President  of  Radcliffe  College,  <em>Ms.</em> magazine explained the origins of her research: </p>
<p>Seven years ago, Matina Horner… was as puzzled as the men in her department by the irregular and disturbing results that came exclusively from female subjects. All sorts of </p>
<p>data  based  on  information  given  by  the  men  were  successfully  fed  into  the  carefully worked-out  test  model,  but  when  it  came  to  the  women,  the  model  went crazy…Bewildered and dissatisfied, the psychologists reluctantly dismissed the women’s data  as  indicating  a  hopeless  “will  to  fail,”  impossible  to  cope  with  in  achievement - motivation work (quoted in Gornick 1971, 50). </p>
<p>Horner and her colleagues studied what postwar American psychologists called the “need for Achievement (<em>nAch</em>),” that is, the drive to succeed. Need for Achievement describes a feeling—a need, a motivation—as the universal source of cultural and economic development. Psychologists tracked feelings by recording and scoring their subjects’ stories, fantasies, unconscious dreams and imaginings. The notion of need—or drive or motivation, which were used interchangeably with  need—was  a  key  concept  for  translating  between  individual  feelings  and  cultural development.  Needs  motivate  people.  They  push  people  to  perform  new  tasks,  start  new businesses, explore new fields of knowledge and to seek out new opportunities. Individual and cultural advancement rely on the propulsive force of needs. Need for Achievement (<em>nAch</em>) stood in for a theory of cultural modernization. </p>
<p>To  measure  their  subjects’  <em>nAch</em>,  psychologists  employed  a  version  of  the  Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) created by Harvard psychologist Henry Murray in the 1930s. Murray designed  the  TAT  to  evaluate  the  components—the  needs  and  motives—of  a  persona.  TAT subjects  were  shown  images,  reproductions  of  magazine  photographs  representing  people  in situations related to the motive being measured. The images were intended to provoke certain motives, to elicit free associations, feelings, thoughts and attitudes about past events related to themes in the photographs. Expert evaluators scored the subjects’ stories, feelings and fantasies with an eye to measuring the subjects’ needs and motivations.  </p>
<p>Horner’s doctoral advisor, John W. Atkinson, and his mentor, David McClelland, worked out a standardized rating system to measure indicators of the <em>nAch</em> in their subjects’ fantasy stories.  The  fantasy  life  of  subjects  with  high  <em>nAch</em>,  their  thoughts  and  unconscious  dreams, contained  imagery  of  evaluation,  performance  and  success.  The  TAT  test  manipulated  its subjects’ achievement motive in a standardized fashion, which could be measured and correlated with  ethnicity,  nationality,  religious  affiliation  and  social  class.  Navajos  and  Brazilians, McClelland  noted,  “change  [their  stories]  in  exactly  the  same  ways  under  the  influence  of achievement arousal” as young American boys (McClelland 1961, 43). </p>
<p>Psychologists  discovered  that  the  <em>nAch</em>  test  results  lined  up  neatly  with  the  cultural paradigm of a postwar white American male. “What good does it do us,” McClelland asked, “to know that a person’s <em>n Achievement</em> score is high?” The answer: “American males with high <em>n Achievement</em> come more often from the middle class than from the lower or upper class, have better memory for uncompleted tasks, are more apt to volunteer as subjects for psychological experiments, are more active in college and community activities, choose experts over friends as working partners, are more resistant to social pressure….” (McClelland 1961, 43). McClelland and his  colleagues  showed  that  men  with  high  <em>nAch</em>  recognize  achievement-related  words  more quickly  and  complete  verbal  and  arithmetic  tests  more  efficiently  than  those  with  low  <em>nAch</em> </p>
<p>(McClelland and Liberman 1949; Lowell 1952). Finally, men with strong achievement motives tend  to  seek  out  opportunities  to  prove  themselves.  Achievement  motivation,  McClelland asserted, offered a key for understanding economic progress and development. </p>
<p>The problem was how to fit women into a psychological model of achievement shaped in the image of a white, middle-class young man. This problem extended beyond the psychology of needs and drives. Feelings about success appeared as an index for a general orientation toward entrepreneurialism,  self  management  and  capitalism.  When  McClelland’s  colleagues  tested female college students, they found that women’s <em>nAch</em> was off the map. Why, then, were they not as successful as their male peers? </p>
<p>Under  the  supervision  of  Horner’s  doctoral  advisor,  John  W.  Atkinson,  two undergraduates at Wesleyan University in the 1950s carried out a test of achievement motivation in female subjects. To their confusion, the experimenters found that many of their female subjects measured higher levels of achievement orientation than their male subjects. The study authors did not know entirely what to make of evidence that women had higher achievement motivation </p>
<p>than men, yet were inferior performers in the social field of modernization. Female students performed  at  high  levels  on  <em>nAch</em>  tests  and  their  results  remained  constant  regardless  of  the experimental  setup.  Their  inner  lives,  seemingly,  were  not  carried  outward  and  forward  as psychological modernization theories predicted.  </p>
<p>Female subjects did not respond to any of the experimental techniques, which had been assumed to hold for all cultures and peoples (as confirmed by results for Navajo and Brazilian boys).   The  experimenters  manipulated  the  study  conditions  so  as  to  increase  or  reduce  the incentive  for  achievement  and  performance.  Whereas  the  boys  responded  markedly  to experimental incentives, girls did not. When experimenters purposefully tried to lower the stakes and  relax  their  subjects’  motivation,  female  students  still  responded  with  exceptionally  high levels  of  <em>nAch</em>.  “The  pattern  of  achievement-related  thoughts  reflected  in  the  thematic apperception of girls in both conditions is like that of the boys in the Achievement Orientation condition” (Veroff et al. 1953, 112). In other words, even “relaxed” female subjects showed higher motivation levels than their male counterparts did under experimentally “aroused” conditions. Girls’  <em>nAch</em>  could  not  be  altered  experimentally.  Their  responses  troubled  the  achievement motivation* construct.  </p>
<p>Why did women’s scores not fit the <em>nAch</em> model? Was it because “girls usually tend to be more motivated in the classroom situation than boys” (Veroff et al. 1953, 112)? Atkinson and Veroff cited research suggesting that any classroom testing situation heightened female students’ </p>
<p>motivation, especially if boys were present. Perhaps a change to a more domestic setting might provide conditions for a successful achievement test? Experimenters repeated a “relaxed’” test of <em>need for Achievement</em> inside a women’s college dormitory, had a female classmate distribute the test in a casual and informal manner, and told the students not to sign their names. To fully replicate a domestic situation (which they thought would lower achievement motivation) they served tea and refreshments. To no avail. The women subjects’ drive to achieve remained higher than that of “relaxed” male peers.  </p>
<p>Atkinson and his students noted a second anomaly. Their <em>nAch</em> experiment, based on the Thematic  Apperception  Test,  employed  “pictures…  especially  chosen  to  portray  cultural situations in which behavior related to the [achievement] motive might be expected to occur”: a woman standing in front of a man’s desk holding papers; two men gesturing to each other; an older woman with her arm around a young girl (Veroff et al. 1953, 108). Because they wished to test female responses, the experimenters included “achievement related situations… in which the main  character  was  female”  (Veroff  et  al.  1953,  109).  They  anticipated  that  female  characters holding papers, mentoring younger women and writing at desks would solicit identifications and fantasies in the female subjects. This, too, did not work as intended. Images of working women produced low levels of achievement fantasy in both boys and girls. Male and female subjects both responded to visual cues of successful men with high levels of achievement feeling, and inversely low levels with cues of successful women. </p>
<p>Female subjects troubled the <em>nAch</em> construct. Atkinson and Veroff concluded that the explanation  must  lie  beyond  psychology,  in  the  cultural  and  social  field.  “This  …result  is consistent with Mead’s discussion of the differentiation of sex roles in the culture to which the Ss [subjects] belong” (Veroff et al. 1953, 112). Cultural and social dynamics appeared to interfere with  women’s  achievement  feelings.  This  is  the  puzzle  that  Matina  Horner  sought  to  solve. Horner  inserted  a  new  category  of  feeling  into  her  analysis  of  women’s  motivation  to achievement: fear. She suspected that women self-edit their own drive to succeed in response to surrounding cultural imagery. </p>
<p><strong>Fear of Success</strong> </p>
<p>Horner  worked  to  repair  the  “major  unresolved  differences”  in  the  theory  of  achievement motivation, caused by female subjects’ anomalous results (Horner 1973, 158). She followed the lineage of her mentor and her mentor’s mentor, John Atkinson and David McClelland. Like them, Horner looked to motives and needs to understand societies and cultures. Fantasies, stories and dreams offered a window onto individual and social dynamics. Horner sought to reconcile the problem of the female exception with the universal ambition of the <em>nAch</em> construct.  </p>
<p>How  to  explain  the  gaps  between  female  and  male  subjects’  need  for  achievement?  Female  students  possessed  high  achievement  motivation—this  was  measurably  present  in Atkinson and Veroff’s tests—but these feelings were not being expressed in fantasies around pictures  of  successful  women.  Although  female  subjects’  natural,  “relaxed”  level  of  <em>nAch</em> appeared equal or higher than boys’ in the “aroused” state, their feelings appeared to remain </p>
<p>internalized. They did not respond to external experimental incentives. Their feelings were not converted into cultural material, as feelings were thought to do. Somehow the operation of <em>nAch</em> was blocked or stunted before it could express itself. Horner introduced a variable to explain this blockage: social stereotypes and expectations. </p>
<p>Women may have been raised with high <em>need for Achievement</em>, but by high school age, Horner thought, something got in their way. Women’s drives and motives were shaped by early childhood experience, as most postwar psychologists believed. But the expression of these needs depended on something else: the social environment of adolescence. “Until recently their families had  stressed  independence  and  achievement  orientation,  factors  shown  by  McClelland  to  be related to, and in fact to facilitate the development of, achievement motivation itself. Suddenly the young women began to feel the “double bind” in the culture’s ambivalence about female achievement”  (Homer  and  Walsh  1973,  128).  Prevailing  cultural  “conceptions  of  femininity” clashed with these women’s childhood training to strive for achievement.  </p>
<p>Achievement-oriented women hit a wall: should they follow their desire to achieve, they risked negative social consequences. Women paid a price for this contradiction in anxiety and a “Fear  of  Success.”  Horner  altered  the  protocols  for  psychological  tests  of  <em>nAch</em>  in  order  to measure levels of Fear of Success (FOS) in her female subjects. She studied FOS in college and </p>
<p>high school co-eds exposed to an image of a successful female role model. Instead of measuring a drive to achieve, Horner measured fantasy imagery around fear: </p>
<p>It is clear from even these preliminary findings that women are paying a high price for their anxiety about success. Otherwise-able young women are prevented from actively seeking success; they perform at lower levels in mixed-sex competitive situations, and many  who  do  succeed  downgrade  their  own  performances  in  the  presence  of  males. Career aspirations are lowered, opportunities are narrowed, and, finally faced with the conflict between their feminine image and the development of their abilities and interests, many women simply abdicate from competition in the outside world (Homer and Walsh 1973,  128). </p>
<p>FOS,  Horner  thought,  was  most  often  unconscious.  Women  appeared  unaware  of  their  self- editing  in  the  face  of  negative  consequences.  FOS  came  from  a  place  outside  the  self  and insinuated itself such as to appear natural. “It has taken us a long time to become aware of the extent to which this image of woman has actually been internalized, thus acquiring the capacity to exert psychological pressures on our behavior of which we are frequently unaware” (Horner 1973, 158). When we turn to women, the problem presents itself as one of self-knowledge and the reality of inner feeling.  </p>
<p>In this process Horner subtly redefined “achievement.” Previous psychological work on <em>nAch</em> in boys took it as a measure of a drive to conquer new tasks, a taste for difficult but feasible challenges. Achievement was seen as a quest for accomplishment for its own sake rather than to please or conform. Although they did correlate <em>nAch</em> scores with performance on verbal anagram tests, most psychologists seemed rather indifferent to the academic performance of their subjects. They  rated  <em>nAch</em>  highly  whether  the  subject  fantasized  about  success  or  failure.  Far  more important  than  good  grades,  <em>nAch</em>  represented  an  individualist  drive  to  find  and  meet  new challenges, regardless of social expectations.  </p>
<p>Horner was much more concerned with performance and social evaluation. Her test cues explicitly defined achievement in terms of academic success: they describe a female student “at the top of her class” and another who “has just been chosen as valedictorian.” The nature of achievement here is external, quantitative and evaluated. Horner defines achievement in a sense </p>
<p>likely more familiar to us today. This kind of achievement comes from outside us, not from within. Achievement responds to a pre-established audit culture. It means getting to the top of the class, the best grades, the highest score. </p>
<p><strong>Wrecked by Success</strong> </p>
<p>A classroom in a large co-ed Midwestern University in the year 1964. Matina Horner, then a doctoral student, hands out short texts describing two characters: John and Anne. She instructs the students to quickly write a short story in response to the text—and to make it interesting. The stories, in Horner’s reading, become indexes of her subjects’ unconscious fantasies and of their </p>
<p>cultural orientation towards success. Female students receive this text: “After the first term finals, Anne finds herself at the top of her medical school class” (Homer and Walsh 1973, 126). Males write to the same lead, in which John is substituted for Anne. Here are some female subjects’ responses to Horner’s story cues: </p>
<p>Anne is a fiction, an impostor, “a code name for a non-existent person created by a group of med students who take turns taking exams and writing papers for Anne.”  </p>
<p>Anne’s  husband  gets  her  pregnant  (he  substitutes  sugar  pills  for  her  birth control) but she returns to her books and lectures an hour after giving birth. “He hits his head against the wall.”  </p>
<p>Anne “has a fear of becoming a lesbian…” (Horner 1973, 163-164) </p>
<p>Horner’s test results painted a picture of a high-achieving woman with deep affective, maternal and  sexual  dysfunction.  Anne  may  have  been  at  the  top  of  her  class,  but  her  existence  as  a woman  appeared  tenuous  at  best.  We  find  a  strange  looping  of  sexuality  in  the  history  of Horner’s  Fear  of  Success.  Anne’s  script  was  already  written  well  before  she  appeared  in  the experimental classroom: she was queer, sexually and maternally frigid. </p>
<p>Anne, in these stories, appears sexually and maternally abnormal, and an impostor. In the  figure  of  Anne,  female  achievement  was  cast  as  queer  social  existence  and  gender malfunction.  In  this  respect  the  students’  stories  echoed  prevailing  psychological  theories. Professional, ambitious women were described in the literature as “phallic” (Ovesey 1962, 84). From  the  start,  psychologists  linked  achievement  inhibition  and  sexual  dysfunction.  In  1916 Freud  described  a  type  of  personality  that  falls  ill  as  a  consequence  of  success.  Like  Lady Macbeth,  this  person  is  “wrecked  by  success.”  Intriguingly,  Freud’s  case  studies,  with  one exception, all revolved around women, sex and marriage. A “typical” case involved a wayward young woman whose lover finally proposed marriage. On obtaining this cherished desire she promptly undermined her fiancé, neglected her house and “soon succumbed to an incurable </p>
<p>mental  illness”  (Freud  1957,  316).  Freud  located  this  reaction  to  success  in  the  “forces  of conscience ” (Freud 1957, 330).  More specifically, Freud described success-illnesses as an Oedipal dynamic. Like all forms of guilt it derived from desire to possess and to destroy one’s parents. Oedipal conflicts in childhood filled the ego with guilt, to the extent that it intervened to prevent a  wished-for  desire  from  happening.  The  root  of  success-illness,  for  Freud,  had  to  do  with frustrated  sexual  desire  for  parents.  In  women,  this  involved  an  inability  to  marry  and  to reproduce (Lady Macbeth, Freud points out, was barren).  In men, the Oedipal dynamic was expressed as a castration complex. </p>
<p>For the most literal-minded Freudians, the formula for success was ridiculously simple: achievement = penis + aggression.  In the 1950s psychologist Lionel Ovesey presented men who feared achievement as castrated “pseudohomosexuals,” and women who sought achievement as fake men. Fear of success, Ovesey thought, came out of childhood rivalries, feelings of guilt and inhibited aggression. The patient withdraws from competition in order to avoid the “murderous retaliation” of his rivals. This fear was tied up with the “universal destructive fantasies in men, death,  castration  and  homosexual  submission”  (Ovesey  1962,  84).  Men  who  feared  success identified themselves with femininity and homosexuality. </p>
<p>Freud’s  cases  of  “wrecked  by  success”  were  almost  all  women.  Ovesey,  by  contrast, associated the “Fear of Vocational Success” with men, “because they are more subject to the competitive pressures of the culture” (Ovesey 1962, 82). Women driven by a need to achieve became sexually perverse. Their ambition stemmed from childhood competitive rivalries with fathers and brothers. Ambition to achieve marked one as a “phallic women.” “The end-product of a competitive failure in a so-called phallic woman is more often than not a castration anxiety. This anxiety may be combined with considerable sexual inhibition and even withdrawal from intercourse  because  the  partner&#39;s  penis  is  erroneously  perceived  as  a  dangerous  weapon” (Ovesey  1962,  84).  (I  note  with  curiosity  that  while  Ovesey  taught  psychology  at  Columbia University, his wife was an advertising executive.) </p>
<p>Horner  despaired  that  “there  appears  to  be  no  successful  escape”  from  the  stifling influence  of  cultural  conceptions  such  as  these.  She  warned  that  the  social  consequences  of frustrated  female  ambition  could  be  severe.  Research  showed  that  women  with  high  Fear  of Success appeared to be more likely to turn to marijuana, LSD or speed to dull their frustration. “Unfulfilled  abilities,  interests,  and  intellectual  potential  give  rise  to  feelings  of  frustration, hostility, aggression, bitterness, and confusion….” (Homer and Walsh 1973, 129). </p>
<p>Horner feared that the problem would get worse: women were having fewer children, partly in response to public no-population growth campaigns. As child-bearing loses its place in women’s lives, “it is necessary that other options for enhancing self-esteem be made available” (Homer and Walsh 1973, 130). <em>Ms.</em> magazine writer Vivian Gornick put it rather more starkly: “Behind the passive exterior of many women there lies a growing anger over lost energies and confused lives, an anger so sharp in its fury but so diffuse in its focus that one can only describe it as the price society must pay for creating a patriarchal system in the first place, and for now refusing to let it go” (Gornick 1971, 52). </p>
<p><strong>Race and Low Achievement Syndrome</strong> </p>
<p>The problem of psychological modernization was a gendered problem. It was a raced problem, too, though race was differently constitutive of psychological modernization theory. Horner’s target population for Fear of Success grafted neatly onto previous studies of high achievement - oriented American middle-class white male subjects. Horner reported that white middle-class women appeared most likely to suffer from FOS. She found low FOS in lower class and nonwhite women; these women, she speculated, were so unlikely to succeed that they had no fear of doing </p>
<p>so. “After all,” she told <em>Ms</em>. magazine, “a girl who’s not too bright and doesn’t have much chance for success to begin with is hardly likely to be frightened by the prospect of success. Whereas, a bright girl from a middle-class home, knowing she actually has it within her possible grasp….” </p>
<p>(Horner,  cited  in  Gornick  1971,  51).  Frustration  was  only  possible,  Horner  suggested,  if  one believes one ought to have what one wants. Women without any chance of success had no reason to fear it. What marked a girl with no chance? Her class and—especially—her race. </p>
<p>The racial other was defined by absence of achievement motives and stimuli. “A recent study (Fleming &amp; Horner) found that black female students produced a 29% incidence of fear-of- success imagery as opposed to the 65-88 % range found in the White female students.… The differences reveal that by achieving success, white women are violating a socially prescribed norm,  while  black  women  are  not.”  Horner  speculated,  “the  conception  of  femininity  was different for black and white women” such that success did not challenge black women’s self image (Homer and Walsh 1973, 128). However, black women’s FOS appeared to be growing higher. Drawing from popular imagery in the 1960s and 1970s of the black matriarch, Horner speculated  that  the  cultural  role  of  black  women  may  be  changing.  As  black  women  found themselves providing for their men more frequently, Horner thought, their FOS was increasing (Homer and Walsh 1973, 128). In the same gesture, Horner challenged gender-bound categories and  reinforced  racially-bound  categories.  The  struggle  to  establish  women  as  subjects  of achievement motivation sustained, even reinforced, exclusion by class and especially by race. One constitutive grid of difference—gender—gave way to another—race. </p>
<p>In  the  modernization  theory  proposed  by  achievement  motivation  psychologists  and developed by Horner, gender was a site of cure. Women’s emancipation would produce a broad social transformation. The cure could be, as David McClelland imagined, by the unmooring of mothers  from  traditional  values,  or,  as  Horner  imagined,  by  the  release  of  women’s  social potential. In both cases gender was the site of repair. Race, by contrast, appeared to have no cure. David McClelland explained low rates of <em>nAch</em> in African-Americans as the inheritance of a child - rearing  style  shaped  by  slavery.  Bizarrely,  he  described  slavery  as  a  form  of  psychological “symbiosis,” which lowered the overall social level of achievement motivation in both slaves and slaveholders. He speculated that the rise and fall of civilization might be traced to the historical tendency of wealthy societies to take slaves. Their children, pampered by slaves obliged to satisfy every whim, were incapable of feeling a need to achieve. Likewise, slaves’ children lacked an achievement  motive,  since  slavery  required  pure  obedience  to  survive.  Because  child-rearing practices passed from generation to generation, psychological decadence continued long after slavery had ended. “Negro slaves should… have developed child-rearing practices calculated to produce  obedience  and  responsibility  not  <em>n  Achievement</em>,  and  their  descendants,  while  free, should still show the effects of such training in lower <em>n Achievement</em> – which in fact is exactly the case” (McClelland 1961, 376). </p>
<p>In the 1960s psychology student Ann Dissinger Mingione reported that black students’ <em>nAch</em> was considerably lower than white subjects’ in the Southern United States. “Negro boys&#39; low scores may be explained by the typical, maternally dominated family constellation… which is related to paucity of job opportunities for Negro men” (Minigione 1965, 110). Ronald Nuttall found that black women with high <em>nAch</em> were “more likely to join the Negro protest groups” such as NAACP, “thus expressing their strivings through attempts to raise the social status of the entire racial group” (Nuttall 1964, 599). Nuttall also observed that black men with high <em>nAch</em> tended  to  see  more  white  in  a  perceptual  color  test,  which  he  interpreted  as  a  form  of identification  with  white  people.  Mingione  later  repeated  her  test  in  a  working-class neighborhood in Boston and found no racial difference (Minigione 1965; Mingione 1968). She concluded that racial prejudice restrained achievement motivation. She saw little potential for change. </p>
<p>By  the  1970s  black  students’  achievement  motivation—at  the  lowest  end  of  the  <em>nAch</em> scale—was  a  topic  of  intense  study  and  concern.  Psychologists  offered  social/structural explanations for the perceived racial disparity in drive to success. African-American students’ efforts were neither sustained nor encouraged by the society around them.  </p>
<p>Teachers’  low  expectations  and  broad  social  discrimination  combined,  psychologists thought, to create a state of “learned helplessness” in African-American students. Like the dogs in Maier, Seligman and Solomon’s famous aversion experiments––dogs who were so conditioned by shock therapy that they ceased trying to escape––black students had learned not to try at school. “Learned helplessness is an appropriate label for the low achievement syndrome, since persons low in achievement motivation do not perceive that effort influences outcome…. Thus cognitive systems associated with achievement strivings may be learned differentially by various racial or ethnic groups” (Weiner 1972, 210). African-American subjects were seemingly saddled by history with a cognitive system that excluded achievement orientation.  </p>
<p>Effects  of  racialized  theories  of  achievement  motivation  persist  still.  Through  to  the present day, there are two parallel and largely disconnected strands of literature on achievement in the United States: the first, around Impostor Syndrome, describes high-performing women in </p>
<p>business, medicine and the academy, and their paralyzing fear of success. The second literature resides in the field of education and addresses the problem of achievement motivation, that is, how to get poor and minority students to want to learn. These educational achievement studies focus on the young African-American child and tend to ignore the adult. Impostor Syndrome, by contrast, is concerned with how to free adult women from the burdens of their childhood. Race weaves through both of these stories, especially since the 1990s as people of color identify and are identified  with  the  Impostor  Syndrome.  Where  educational  research  takes  low  minority achievement as a real problem to be countered, psychologists of the Impostor Syndrome take impostorism as a false problem of self-perception, to be corrected. The first case is constitutive and difficult or impossible to cure; the second perceptual and curable. </p>
<p><strong>A Feminist Self-Cure</strong> </p>
<p>I started this research as a reparative project of self-cure or self-care for myself and for others, and now I must contend with the non-innocent histories of feminist cures and cares. What are the possibilities of a reparative history; what forms of past, present and future might it foreclose or open? What legacies do the raced and gendered histories of the Impostor Syndrome leave for us to contend with? Can these inheritances become objects of care or repair? </p>
<p>Curing  women’s  misdirected  feelings  became  one  of  the  central  preoccupations  of postwar  technocratic  feminists.  Technocratic  feminists,  as  historian  Laura  Micheletti  Puaca describes  them,  wielded  the  language  of  national  security  to  argue  for  greater  women’s participation  in  science  and  engineering.  Social  misconceptions  about  women’s  ability, internalized  by  women  themselves,  were  damaging  the  nation’s  supply  of  critical  scientific “manpower.”  “By  embracing  the  language  of  [military]  preparedness,  technocratic  feminists presented the education, employment and advancement of women as paramount to Cold War manpower needs” (Puaca 2014, 73). At the 1958 Conference for the Participation of Women in Science, Johns Hopkins chemist Betty Lou Raskin assessed women’s status in language nearly </p>
<p>identical to Horner’s later work. Disparities between male and female scientists came not from any “intellectual incompetence or lack of creative ability.” Rather, “it is the fault of our cultural conditioning and our poor vocational guidance” (Puaca 2014, 121).  Microbiologist Polly Bunting, Horner’s predecessor as the Dean of Radcliffe College, blamed a “climate of un-expectation” for the waste of valuable women’s talent (Puaca 2014, 148). As historian Michelle Murphy suggests, girls appeared and still appear as an untapped source of human capital, waiting to be liberated. </p>
<p>Feminist promissories about young women’s locked-up potential value emerged decades before “the Girl” became a “figure of transnational rescue and investment” (Murphy 2012b). </p>
<p>Feminist psychologists took up the project of releasing women’s locked-up power as a therapeutic goal. The Impostor diagnosis dates to 1978, when clinical psychologists Pauline Rose Clance  and  Suzanne  Ament  Imes  published  a  description  of  “The  Impostor  Phenomenon  in High-achieving Women.” Drawing upon Matina Horner’s work, Clance and Imes formulated the Impostor  Phenomenon  as  a  feminist  response  to  the  twentieth-century  psychology  of achievement  motivation.  They  describe  a  cure  for  the  condition  that  Horner  labeled  Fear  of Success. </p>
<p>Clance developed a diagnostic test for Impostor Phenomenon (IP), on which respondents note their level of agreement with statements like these: </p>
<ul>
<li>I have often succeeded on a test or task even though I was afraid that I would not do well before I undertook the task. </li>
<li>I avoid evaluations if possible and have a dread of others evaluating me. </li>
<li>I’m afraid people important to me may find out that I’m not as capable as they think I am. </li>
<li>If I receive a great deal of praise and recognition for something I’ve accomplished, I tend to discount the importance of what I’ve done. </li>
<li>At times, I feel my success has been due to some kind of luck. (Clance 1985) </li>

</ul>
<p>A study of the Clance IP Scale identified three factors that account for most of its variation: fakery, luck and discounting (Chrisman et al. 1995). In sum, an IP subject feels like a fake. She attributes her successes to luck and she discounts their significance. This is the core definition of the Impostor Phenomenon. </p>
<p>Like Horner, Clance and Imes identified Impostor Phenomenon as a female problem. “Horner indicates that many women have motive to avoid success out of a fear that they will be rejected or considered less feminine if they do succeed. …for women to succeed in this culture is indeed a fearsome venture” (Clance and Imes 1978, 5). Men, Clance and Imes believed, tend to attribute their success to internal qualities and capabilities, whereas women “project the cause of success outward to an external cause (luck) or to a temporary internal quality (effort) that they do not equate with inherent ability” (Clance and Imes 1978, 242). Men affected by IP tended to be those “more in touch with their feminine qualities” (Clance and Imes 1978, 241). Psychologists replicating Clance and Imes’s work found that men report IP feelings as frequently as women; however, the initial gendering of diagnosis stuck. Clance later suggested that even if feelings may appear at similar rates across the sexes, women suffer more from their effects. “Women are more likely to be limited, and limited more powerfully, by the Impostor Phenomenon”(Clance and O&#39;Toole 1987, 2). </p>
<p>The  Impostor  Phenomenon  took  shape  through  conversations  Clance  and  her collaborator, Suzanne Imes, held with women undergraduates at the Oberlin College counseling center. “Some women were coming in and saying, ‘They asked me to do an honors thesis, but I&#39;m not going to, because if I do they&#39;re going to find out all I don&#39;t know’” (Clance and Ojerholm 1995).  Clance  connected  outsider  feelings  she  had  experienced  in  graduate  school  with  these students’ hesitation to put themselves forward or to accept positive evaluation.  She and Imes began holding workshops for undergraduate women to work through their impostor feelings, where  they  encouraged  women  to  put  themselves  forward  with  confidence.  The  Impostor </p>
<p>Phenomenon construct emerged from Clance’s activist therapeutic work at Oberlin and Georgia State University. Clance and Imes took care to identify the condition as a “phenomenon” rather than a disorder or “syndrome,” “because all along it&#39;s been very important for us not to have this be another ‘defect’ in women or a pathologizing of women” (Clance and Ojerholm 1995). (It is interesting to note that the current popular version of Clance’s concept—Impostor Syndrome— performs the very pathologization that she had tried hard to prevent.) </p>
<p>For Clance, IP was mainly about self-perception: specifically, self-deception. IP subjects’ biggest problem, she thought, was that they were maladjusted to their own reality. “The reality was  that  the  students  who  were  feeling  like  impostors  were  among  the  highest  ranked students…. These subjects were ingenious at negating objective external evidence that indicated they  were  indeed  very  bright”  (Clance  and  O’Toole  1987,  1).  Women  with  IP  block  out knowledge of their own success: “On an unconscious level the impostor phenomenon allows a woman  to  deal  with  her  ambivalence  about  being  successful,  by  allowing  her  to  keep  her achievement out of her awareness” (Clance et al. 1995, 84). </p>
<p>In  other  words,  IP  subjects  convince  themselves  of  a  falsehood,  in  order  to  protect themselves from potentially harmful consequences of the truth. In this sense they are practicing deception, as they themselves fear. However, their fabrication, their imposture, happens only within their own minds. They convince themselves that they are someone (an incompetent, a dolt) whom they are not. </p>
<p>In its most basic dynamic, IP involves self-deception. People with IP experience a split between feeling (imposture) and reality (success and achievement). IP subjects believe that they lack qualities of intelligence and competence, despite objective evidence to the contrary. Indeed, as their paper title indicates, Clance and Imes identified IP as a problem specifically experienced </p>
<p>by “high-achieving women.” They took achievement as a necessary precondition for IP. Impostor thoughts  and  feelings  functioned  to  negate  successes  that  had  already  been  attained.  The  IP diagnosis described a gap between self-awareness and reality. </p>
<p>In an echo of 1970s consciousness-raising groups, Clance designed a group therapy for IP subjects  that  would  foster  acceptance  of  reality.   “The  client  needs  to  become  aware  of  the superstitious, magical aspects of her impostor belief” (Clance and Imes 1978, 6). Group therapy clients  exposed  the  untruth  of  each  other’s  self-perceptions,  gently  correcting  negative  self- statements, pointing out patterns and inconsistencies. Treating clients with IP, Clance sought to restore truth for self-lies, reality for self-deception. </p>
<p>Pauline Clance’s work revolved around individual recognition of the true and collective unveiling of the false. Her cure for an IP subject was to reveal the true and objective self (not the deep, unconscious self but the socially achieving self), to identify with the true self in public and in  private.  Clance’s  group  therapy  allowed  the  patient  to  see  herself  reflected  in  others  and thereby recognize the “magical” and deceptive qualities of the IP story. </p>
<p>Pauline Clance’s therapy led women to see through the false and superstitious quality of their  own  self-deception.  Clance  and  Horner’s  contemporary,  feminist  psychologist  Carol Gilligan, worked to expose the deceptions inherent in constructs like the <em>need for Achievement</em>. Gilligan’s cure involved a rejection of the psychological scale itself. </p>
<p>Carol  Gilligan  represents  a  sort  of  common  ancestor  for  contemporary  reparative scholarship. With Gilligan, the histories of Impostor Syndrome, <em>nAch</em> and motivation psychology fold into histories of care and repair. She was a colleague of David McClelland’s at Harvard University beginning in 1967, and cites him extensively in her work. Though her research focuses mainly on moral psychology she has training in achievement motivation. She even collaborated on one of Walter Mischel’s famous marshmallow experiments on delayed gratification, which </p>
<p>measured correlations between self-control and the <em>need for Achievement</em> (Mischel and Gilligan 1964). </p>
<p>In the opening pages of her keystone book, <em>In a Different Voice</em>, Gilligan sets her project directly  in  dialogue  with  those  of  David  McClelland  and  Matina  Horner.  Gilligan  quotes McClelland’s admission that, “[psychologists] have tended to regard male behavior as the ‘norm’ and  female  behavior  as  some  kind  of  deviation  from  that  norm”(McClelland  1975  cited  in Gilligan 2009, 10). For Gilligan, Horner’s work offered a cautionary example. When women do not display the same achievement motivation as men, Gilligan notes, Horner finds “something wrong” with her female subjects. Gilligan questions whether the women in <em>nAch</em> studies were actually expressing achievement motivation or rather, a distaste for competition. Perhaps female subjects just did not care about achievement. Perhaps Anne did not <em>want</em> to be at the top of her medical school class (Gilligan 2009, 12). </p>
<p>Drawing  from  women’s  test  responses,  Gilligan  sought  to  build  an  alternative worldview. She valorized differences in female and male responses as an index of a different set of values. Whereas male subjects tended to refer to individual rights to justify moral decisions, Gilligan  found  that  her  female  subjects  thought  relationally.  Women  tended  to  consider  the effects of moral actions on others, in a web of close and distant relationships. Female subjects’ moral thinking, she found, referred not to universal rights but to partial, contextual, situated relationships. Gilligan named this situated, relational ethics an <em>ethics of care</em>. </p>
<p>One senses that Gilligan, Clance and Horner undertook their research as a form of self-cure. Both Gilligan and Horner replicated the work of their research supervisors (Lawrence Kohlberg and John W. Atkinson) in order to bring women into the picture as positive subjects rather than aberrant  results.  One  might  imagine  a  reader  of  <em>Ms.</em>  embracing  their  advice  in  concert:  feel confident in your judgment as a distinctly feminine style of caring, cure your self of fear and push forward in the world of achievement. Recognize your true worth, evacuate fear, begin to truly live for the first time. </p>
<p>Horner, Clance and Gilligan established the language and the technology of the feminist self-cure: self-awareness and valorization, rejection of prevailing masculine norms and standards, and collective affirmation of a female commonality, the universal “woman.” The figure of the Impostor  Syndrome  comes  out  of  that  conjunction,  as  do  the  consciousness-raising  group therapies designed to cure it. I suggest that the current reparative turn also refers back to this nexus. </p>
<p><strong>A Reparative Turn</strong> </p>
<p>My search for a cure ends here. The feminist self-cure for high-achieving anxiety does not offer closure. It opens new questions and anxieties. Michelle Murphy identifies the late twentieth - century feminist self-cure, focused on self-awareness, as a raced project of “self-possession.”  The feminist self-cure marks a self that is free and available to be cured by its own work; it assumes that the body is healthy, “normal” and autonomous. This kind of cure cannot assimilate race, class and structural violence. Murphy writes, “whiteness—in heralding self-possession—often works to displace attention from the necropolitical work of race” (Murphy 2012a, 44). My desire for a self-cure obscures the inequalities, exclusions and the uneven kinships that structure the problem of anxiety and achievement. </p>
<p>Reparative scholarship offers a positive orientation, a hope to live more fully and feel better. But there is a downside. Feminist scholar Robyn Wiegman calls out the narcissism of reparative reading. She warns against the instrumentality of repair, the seizing upon an object of study  as  a  means  to  repair  the  self  and  to  re-establish  the  value  of  our  own  scholarly  work (Wiegman 2014, 18). Much reparative scholarship casts research as therapy: asking of the object to sustain our world, to cure us. Eve Sedgwick imagines that a reparative reader would attach to an object and “help himself” (Sedgwick 2002, 115). This one-way transit of feeling ends at an exclusionary cul-de-sac. Sometimes feeling better is just not worth it. </p>
<p>Following  Sara  Ahmed,  Wiegman  and  Murphy  remind  us  that  bad,  failed  and  ugly feelings are critical shields against the unrelenting positive projects of the present (Ahmed 2010; Murphy  2015,  3).  Anxiety,  depression,  discomfort  and  anger  perform  important  work.  They direct our attention to things that need fixing. The urgency of unpleasant feelings, the importance of  their  resistance  to  understanding  and  possession,  are  what  I  attach  to  Donna  Haraway’s injunction to “stay with the trouble” (Haraway 2010). There is no total cure, no heroic act of rescue, that can or should make it all go away. If we attend to the trouble, if we stay with it and care for it, there may be bits of life to repair. </p>
<p>In one sense, repair names the awesome task of maintaining stability, the status quo. Of bridging  past  and  future.  Of  painstakingly  sustaining  lives  and  restoring  objects.  Steven  J. Jackson attends to repair as a moral and material attachment to things. He calls on us to replace the  shiny  patina  of  innovation  studies  with  studies  of  repair  and  “broken  world  thinking.” Jackson  evokes  “reverence”  in  the  face  of  “the  remarkable  resilience,  creativity,  and  sheer magnitude of the work represented in the ongoing maintenance and reproduction of established order” (Jackson 2014, 222). Repair figures as a counterforce to decay, disposal, disruption and opposition. But the workers whose bodies labor in the toxic ruins, culling recyclables with tools of fortune, are not sustained by their repair work. As the byproducts of disposable consumption pile up in toxic ecologies, their devalued work of repair appears ever more urgent and fraught with danger. Jackson expresses both “hope and concern” over the potentials of  “a world in constant  process  of  fixing  and  reinvention,  reconfiguring  and  reassembling  into  new combinations and new possibilities” (Jackson 2014, 222). </p>
<p>In  another  sense,  repair  implies  reassembly.  Michelle  Murphy  finds  an  “ethic  of reassembly”  at  work  in  late  twentieth-century  feminist  self-help  collectives  “aspiring  to  craft protocols that could foster change, move between sites, and be tailored to particular needs as decided by individuals or small groups” (Murphy 2012a, 30). Murphy notices many non-innocent reassemblages of women’s health care, many of which are in urgent need of repair. In that same late  twentieth-century  moment,  Donna  Haraway  wrote  that  we  are  all,  objects  and  people, “reasonably thought of in terms of disassembly and reassembly” (Haraway 1989, 186). Perhaps a reparative history is a reassembly of the problem into something that we can work with. </p>
<p>As Maria Puig de la Bellacasa reminds us, to work with care is to reassemble what is broken,  damaged  or  hurtful.   Caring  is  a  “transformative  ethos”  that  works  to  make  livable worlds. Care reshapes things. In a caring or careful account, “critical cuts should not merely expose or foster conflict but should produce caring relations” (de la Bellacasa 2011, 97). For every critical cut, she reminds us, we must form a reattachment. The work of caring is not prescriptive. It is site-specific. Bellacasa does not wish to replace criticism with a happy, virtuous and benign form of care. Rather she calls for forms of care that cut. Caring means to recognize oppressions and oppositions.  </p>
<p>Bellacasa thinks with care in order to reassemble what is exclusionary and damaging. She attends to who is doing the caring, for whom and how, and to the “devalued ordinary labors that are crucial for getting us through the day” (de la Bellacasa 2011, 93). Care is “an ethically and politically charged practice, that has been at the forefront of feminist concerns about devalued </p>
<p>labors” (de la Bellacasa 2011, 90). Care is not bounded by field of study or practice. It infuses all tasks—communication, sociability, epistemology, maintenance—involved in making the world livable. Bellacasa identifies these key components of care: worry and thoughtfulness, a sense of belonging to those affected, “a strong sense of attachment and commitment,” and a material practice.  </p>
<p>Repair contains political possibilities, which have not yet been picked up by theories of care and repair. Reparative history is also about reparations, a calling to account for the legacies of injustice. Ta-Nehisi Coates writes of the need for “full acceptance of our collective biography and its consequences.” Reparations stand for a complete accounting of continuing damages due to  the  historical  crimes  of  slavery.  They  entail  a  “national  reckoning,”  “  an  airing  of  family secrets, a settling with old ghosts,” “a revolution of the American consciousness, a reconciling of our self-image as the great democratizer with the facts of our history” (Coates 2014). Reparations enjoin everyone implicated in this shared history to engage in a collective form of accounting and repair. Finally, reparations call for change, for making amends. </p>
<p>Thinking  with  Murphy,  Jackson,  Haraway,  Bellacasa  and  Coates,  I  might  imagine  a reparative  history  as  a  non-innocent  accounting  for  the  past  and  a  making  of  amends.  A reassembly,  refiguring  and  reconfiguring  objects  to  make  them  more  livable.  A  generous, generative process, testing, cutting and employing old tools in different ways. I am interested less in deconstruction than in serious tinkering. </p>
<p><strong>Reassemblages</strong> </p>
<p>What legacies do the raced and gendered histories of the Impostor Syndrome leave for us to reassemble?  The  Impostor  Syndrome  reflects  anxiety  around  partial,  situated  knowledges. Feelings of imposture reinforce the fantasy of a god’s eye, total ideal. When I declare myself an impostor, I imagine a totalizing knowledge and vision, to which I do not have access. This is the vision of mastery, a mastery that is intimately related to legacies of enslavement, exploitation and cooptation.  It  is  what  Coates  calls  the  Dream,  an  insouciant  sense  of  owning  the  world  that characterizes the American culture of whiteness (Coates 2015, 50). It is a desire to master and possess. When I attribute this total vision to others, when I apologize for lacking it myself, I associate myself with the Dream of mastery.  </p>
<p>This history of <em>nAch</em> makes the Dream explicit. Twentieth-century psychologists bound a modernizing affect, the drive to achieve, to the material conquest of property, prosperity and success. David McClelland used <em>nAch</em> to explain the “rise of civilization.” This is a white, middle - class  American  civilization,  built  on  an  ideology  of  individual  motivation  and  spreading  its achievement-oriented  feelings  around  the  globe  in  a  kind  of  <em>affective  imperialism</em>.  The  same psychological project seeks to modernize developing peoples, and then doubles back to exclude African-Americans.  On  material-historical  grounds,  they  are  not  given  access  to  that psychological key to well being and success. This is our contemporary achievement world: the drive, the confidence, the Dream that a problem or challenge can be solved, mastered and turned to  one’s  material  advantage.  The  Impostor  Syndrome  is  a  symptom  of  discomfort  with  the Dream. </p>
<p>The dynamics of paranoia, suspicion and falsification resonate with the history of the Impostor Syndrome. As Sedgwick writes, paranoia “mobilizes guile against suspicion, suspicion against guile” (Sedgwick 2002, 93). The critic is on the lookout for fakers, impostors, subterfuges. Naturally one also turns this suspicion against oneself. Paranoia, phobia and Fear of Success share a common Freudian root in the psychoanalysis of homosexuality. Fear and suspicion mark one as queer or as “passing.&quot; As out of place, and faking it. </p>
<p>This is a cruel vision of culture, wherein the entire field beyond one’s own head operates as  a  totalizing  audit  apparatus.  Often  this  vision  is  not  so  far  from  that  prevailing  in  the contemporary intellectual-academic field, which is why it works so effectively. I find it striking that  many  of  the  core  assumptions  of  achievement  psychology  are  held  unreflectively  by otherwise socially and intellectually sensitive thinkers. Discussions of research productivity are typically insulated from critical reflection. These discussions take place in personnel meetings, behind closed doors; whereas critical reflection takes place in open talks, publications and panels. Perhaps because one’s livelihood—money and achievement—depends on what happens in the closed-door rooms, but liveliness happens in rooms with open doors.  </p>
<p>A statement of imposture is a declaration of partial and situated knowledge, designed to lower expectations. A series of preemptive apologies. (“I’m not an expert on this topic; I’ve only just begun this project and it’s not yet fully formed; I hope that this work will be adequate to the venue/ audience/ readers….”) Such statements apologize for the quality of the speech to come, the speaker’s lack of standing to address a problem, for an inadequate or partial communication. I did this myself at the start of this article, by attaching all sorts of ill-portending modifiers to my performance (“narcissistic,” “presentist,” “partial”). The paranoid vision is occasioned by a call to judgment of the self, the expectation of being called out.  I assume that other people can do the </p>
<p>god-trick,  can  summon  up  closures  and  objective  judgments  that  I  cannot.  I  imagine  partial, situated knowledges as faulty, weak and perhaps even fraudulent. These apologies only reinforce a vision and an objective of total mastery. </p>
<p>A reparative history might reassemble these technologies of achievement and imposture. The <em>Reassembled Impostor</em> seeks strategies not of distance and non-being (imposture, modesty) but of proximity and immodesty. She restores a place and a time to the “nobody’’ and “nowhere” of Impostor Syndrome. She shifts her affective investment from a god’s eye view, a drive for total mastery, to local, particular knowledge worlds. She starts every conference talk and every class with a declaration not of imposture but of situation, the relations and social positioning in the fields of situated knowledge. She is not always pleasant or polite, for this too is a tactic of non - existence. She attaches herself to moments of quickening and interest in herself and others and tries to build on them, make them grow, imagine their possibilities. </p>
<p>The Reassembled Impostor tinkers with the mechanisms of evaluation and achievement to make them more just and livable. She considers the instruments of evaluation, tools used on and by her, as social-affective technologies. She is cognizant of the speeds of modernization, entrepreneurship  and  career  advancement,  and  manipulates  these  speeds  by  inserting  place - holders and stop-gaps with whatever materials are at hand. She seeks to foster other kinds of differential  subjectivity  (Sandoval  2000).  She  celebrates  spaces  of  anti-achievement,  of  failure, play and exploration (Halberstam 2011). She is responsible for shared histories of injustice and works where she can to make amends for past exclusions. She reassembles achievement worlds.  Knowing where some of the breaks happened—when women became curable, when African - American children were marked as lacking <em>nAch</em>—I look for the mechanisms of that break, and </p>
<p>the  possibilities  for  repair.  I  return  to  the  original  problem—to  cure  myself  of  the  Impostor Syndrome—and  replace  it  with  a  new  set  of  problems.  I  mark  the  “problem”  of  minority educational  achievement  as  co-constituted  with  the  “problem”  of  undomesticated  female achievement.  I  resist  relations  of  rescue,  with  their  distancing  superiority  complex.  All  of  us marked by <em>nAch</em> share an achievement world generating disparities of race, power and income. This is a shared set of realities, into which we are slotted unevenly. </p>
<p>For these reasons I refuse to offer a cure for the Impostor Syndrome. I will not try to overcome my discomfort with the Dream. The desire for mastery always involves closing the doors of rooms where livelihoods are partitioned. Any cure that promises mastery of the self, self-possession, must forget those discomforts and what lies outside the closed doors. The first strategy of repair is to be responsible for my own desire to make myself feel better. I will not replicate the closure of the self-cure, or mask anxieties, ambiguities and exclusions. Nor will I affirm  the  impostor  diagnosis,  for  this  too  obscures  my  responsibilities  and  my  proximity.  I would rather reassemble the problem and recognize the essential critical work of thinking with care and anxiety.  </p>
