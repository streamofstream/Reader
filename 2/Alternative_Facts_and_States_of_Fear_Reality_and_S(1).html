<p><strong>Abstract</strong>  In the decades since the Science Wars of the 1990s, climate science has become a crucible for the negotiation of claims about reality and expertise. This negotiation, which has drawn explicitly on the ideas and techniques of science and technology studies (STS), has taken place in genres of fiction as well as non-fiction, which intersect in surprising ways. In this case study, I focus on two interwoven strands of this history. One follows Michael Crichton s best-selling 2004 novel, <em>State of Fear</em> and its reception by neo-conservatives as a commentary on the mis-uses of facts to stoke fear about anthropogenic climate change. The other considers Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway s 2010 publishing success <em>Merchants of Doubt</em> as the inverse, a demonstration of the forms of disinformation that have been used to undermine scientific consensus around climate change. I show that both Crichton s as well as Oreskes and Conway s approaches were critiqued by academic STS even as their accounts constituted the most high-profile performances of its stakes and the politics of knowledge since the Science Wars. In highlighting the STS practices deployed by each, as well as how those practices were differently linked to accusa- tions of fear-mongering and a perversion of the purity of STS, I demonstrate the need for a reflexive history of STS. Such an approach, I argue, can better consider the social life of STS ideas and practices amidst calls for more politically-engaged approaches to knowledge production.</p>

<p><strong>What is an Alternative Fact?</strong></p>
<p>In January of 2017, days after the inauguration of President Trump and historic Women s March, I began teaching a graduate seminar called Problems in Science Studies, an intro to the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS). Our first substantive task was to reckon with a time-honored question  What is a fact?  through the now classic works of Thomas Kuhn (1962) and Ludwik Fleck (1935, translated into English in 1979). These works, which have long anchored STS and history of science syllabi, are considered influential for having situated fact-making as a social enterprise (i.e., Richards and Daston 2016). Though I had taught the class many times before, I was not prepared for exactly how much the political climate would have a chilling effect on our discussion.</p>
<p>If this essay were being presented as a piece of fiction, one might find heavy- handed the detail that this session, on facts, coincided with Trump Advisor Kelly- anne Conway s now infamous interview on <em>Meet the Press</em>. On January 22, Con- way argued, to the disbelief of host Chuck Todd (and many others), that Press Secretary Sean Spicer had not lied about the attendance at Trump s inauguration. Rather, he had presented  alternative facts,  rooted in different, albeit opaque strate- gies of quantification.<sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-1' name='ref-footnote-1'>1</a></sup> She later defended her phrasing, defining  alternative facts  as  additional facts and information  (Nuzzi 2017). In the weeks following, sales of George Orwell s novel <em>1984</em>, a tale of governance via disinformation, increased nearly 10,000%, leading it to become the #1 bestseller on Amazon.com (Seaton 2017).</p>
<p>Orwell may have predicted the rise of  newspeak,  but another novelist was on my mind. I was thinking of the late Michael Crichton (he died in 2008), whose body of work has also been distinguished by its preoccupation with the politics of knowl- edge. I had recently begun a new book project attempting to consider what Crich- ton s career, which spanned the late 1960s through the early  21st century, might reveal about changes in public understanding of and skepticism towards science as well as STS itself. With degrees from Harvard in anthropology and medicine, Crichton made a name for himself by laundering an impressive amount of expertise into blockbuster pulp fiction including <em>The Andromeda Strain</em> (1969) and <em>Jurassic Park</em> (1990). These works not only introduced audiences to controversial uses of sci- ence such as germ warfare and genetic engineering, they also shaped public opinion about the potential consequences (Radin 2019). In an epigraph to his controversial 2004 novel <em>State of Fear</em>, which took on the science of climate modeling, Crichton quoted Orwell saying,  Within any important issue, there are always aspects no one wishes to discuss.  On the same page, he also quoted Mark Twain,  There is some- thing fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact. </p>
<p>These two epigraphs highlighted an important problem with knowledge that went to the heart of Trump s election and its aftermath: that facts could not be trusted to speak for themselves, if they even mattered any longer at all. While certain mainstream media outlets  immediate response to Trump s dubious asser- tions during and after the campaign was to assiduously fact-check them, with his election, a different reality was unfolding in which the ability to verify facts was no longer a sufficient or in some views even necessary precondition for politi- cal authority or action. Trump s apparent embodiment of both Orwell s futuris- tic  Big Brother  and Twain s uniquely American  confidence man  provoked ideological hand-wringing, leading some to place blame on practices of the left- leaning academy: namely postmodernism and cultural Marxism (summarized by and interpreted in Mirrlees 2018). A dangerous mix of relativism and identity politics, these critics charged, had contributed to the erosion of faith in American institutions of democracy and science, and of shared reality grounded in truth (e.g., Pinker 2018; Lukianoff and Haidt 2018).</p>
<p>As I struggled with how to respond to my students  anxieties, I turned to his- tory, specifically the history of STS. I recounted to them the terms of the bitter Science Wars of the 1990s, which cast postmodern theory and social constructiv- ism (Collins 1983; Bijker et al. 1987; Woolgar 1991; Winner 1993) as anathema to scientific objectivity. It began with a hoax, when physicist and mathematician Alan Sokal confessed to publishing a fraudulent academic article in the journal <em>Social Text.</em> He and other*   science warriors  cast those who affirmed fact-mak- ing as a fundamentally human, and therefore social, enterprise as engaged in a rejection of reality (Sokal 1996; Gross and Levitt 1997). They took greatest issue with the methodological principle of symmetry, which held that the same types of cause should be used to explain  true  and  false  beliefs (Bloor 1991), sug- gesting it implied an anything-goes form of relativism at the cost of objectiv- ity, which alone could confirm absolute truth. STS scholars countered that it was not possible to appreciate the full power of facts without attending to their social dimensions  (Ross  1996;  Hilgartner  1997;  Latour  1999),  which  they  had  long argued meant considering questions of expertise, credibility, situatedness, and power (see, for example, Latour and Woolgar 1979; Shapin and Schaffer 1985; Harding and Hinitkka 1983; Haraway 1988; Jasanoff 1990).</p>
<p>The Science Wars put the academic field of STS on the defensive right when what it had to contribute to public understanding of science was becoming most urgent. To those outside the profession, elucidating the complex politics of fact- making a project of asking what it means to be a reliable knower appeared reduced to a standoff between so-called realists, who believed in truth, versus relativists, who allegedly did not. The construction of such an artificial binary, and even the idea of a war with two sides, reinforced the idea that nothing less than reality itself was at stake and that victory would result in the surrender or outright defeat of one side or the other. This configuration emerged again in the fall of 2018 when another academic hoax was perpetrated. Calling their project,  Sokal Squared,  because they had published not one but several fake articles, the authors of these pieces took issue with forms of social science research that they saw directly engaging politics in the service of addressing a variety of social </p>
<p>inequalities. Such an emotion-driven approach to scholarship, they argued, repre- sented a corruption of scientific objectivity.<sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-2' name='ref-footnote-2'>2</a></sup></p>
<p>In 2017, as President Trump placed sanctions on the Environmental Protection Agency as one of his first orders of business, my students worried that STS had been complicit in their dystopian political present. The  Sokal Squared  hoax would fur - ther confuse the issue, making many uneasy about the field s activist potential that it might be too politicized, yet somehow not political enough. Were STS practition- ers obliged to participate in navigating a political landscape of disinformation that seemed hostile to science? Was a defense of science, given its own history as an instrument of state violence, tantamount to a defense of the status quo? Was the field part of the problem or part of the solution? Neither? Or perhaps both?<sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-3' name='ref-footnote-3'>3</a></sup> To these questions I added my own: what did it mean to apply the methods of STS without an awareness of history of how they had been taken up in the years since the Science Wars? And where, in an age dubbed one of  post-truth,  is it possible to examine STS in use in the service of politics? Could a more robust conception of reality be reclaimed through a more serious attention to genres of fiction?</p>
<p>In this case study, I trace two strands of this history since the Science Wars through works regarded by their publishers as fiction and non-fiction. One focuses on Michael Crichton s (2004) novel, <em>State of Fear</em> and its reception by neo-conserv- atives as a commentary on the mis-use of facts to stoke fear about anthropogenic climate change. The other considers Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway s 2010 <em>Merchants of Doubt</em> as the inverse, an archivally-driven demonstration of the forms of disinformation used to undermine scientific consensus, especially around climate change.</p>
<p>Both Crichton and Oreskes have since been criticized as being peripheral to STS even as their two works have arguably been the highest-profile STS-inspired com- mentaries on the politics of knowledge since the Science Wars. Indeed, as I will show, both parties wound up testifying before the U.S. Congress on the relationship between science and politics though towards opposing political ends. In highlight- ing the STS practices deployed by each, as well as how those practices were differ- ently linked to accusations of fear-mongering, I demonstrate the need for a reflex- ive history of STS (e.g., Hess 2013) that is attentive to how its practices have been deployed across genres beyond academia and in concert with emotional appeals for and against political action.</p>
<p>I consider both Crichton s as well as Oreskes and Conway s engagements with climate change denialism as forms of STS in so far as they each have had something to say about the slipperiness of facts <em>and</em> that they both explicitly draw upon prac- tices of STS in order to do so. I am less interested in undertaking a  symmetrical analysis  (Bloor 1991) of what Crichton versus Oreskes and Conway have to say about the reality of climate change than in examining how their respective attention to (or explicit rejection of) STS principles like symmetry have allowed them to make their arguments and opened them to various critiques from other STS scholars (e.g., Fuller 2017). My approach is to follow Crichton s as well as Oreskes and Conway s engagements with the politics of fear and the techniques of STS across publishing genres of fiction and non-fiction. The result reveals a surprising amount of inter- weaving, suggesting that some of the boldest efforts to come to grips with facts are now taking place in the realm of fiction, with important consequences for the prac- tice of STS.</p>
<p><strong>Symmetry and the  Orwellian Problem</strong> </p>
<p>Naomi Oreskes and her collaborator Erik M. Conway have made explicit efforts to provoke political action around science and technology in the name of STS. Oreskes, who is now a Professor of History of Science at Harvard, was previously Professor of History at University of California at San Diego, where she also directed its inter- disciplinary Science Studies program. Conway is a historian of science and technol- ogy at Caltech. In their influential 2010 book <em>Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming</em>, they presented historical evidence that a sustained strategy of disinformation, engi- neered with the help of public relations experts, had been used for more than half a century to discredit science in order to uphold extreme free market positions. In their account, which drew on corporate archives, they described how conservative think tanks and a small group of  Cold Warrior  scientists sought to undermine sci- ence and rewrite history.</p>
<p>Such scientists claimed that biologist Rachel Carson s 1962 book <em>Silent Spring</em>, which prompted environmental regulation to protect ecosystems from the long-term effects of pesticides like DDT, had been based on bad science. Figures like Dixie Lee Ray, a zoologist and Democratic Governor of Washington State were among those who accused environmentalists like Carson of having distorted science by creating  an atmosphere in which scientific evidence can be pushed aside by emo- tion, hysteria, and political pressure  (Ray and Guzzo 1992, cited in Oreskes and Conway 2010: 231). Oreskes and Conway also cited Michael Crichton, who in his  2004 novel [<em>State of Fear</em>], portrayed global warming as a liberal hoax meant to bring down Western capitalism,  noting that one character participates in this par- ticular revisionist history by arguing,  Banning DDT killed more people than Hit- ler it was so safe you could eat it  (Crichton  2004, cited in Oreskes and Conway 2010: 233). They emphasized that the same conservative think tanks that continued to peddle doubt about climate science embraced and even  promoted the work of the late fiction writer Michael Crichton,  (Crichton 2004, cited in Oreskes and Conway 2010: 232 233).</p>
<p>Oreskes and Conway also invoked Orwell. In their case it was to show how these merchants of doubt had promoted a form of  government that manufactured fake history to support its political programs,  with the idea that gaining control of the past would allow them to shape the future (Oreskes and Conway 2010: 236). They also observed  deep irony  in that Orwell was a Cold Warrior himself, a  great hero of the anti-Communist political right wing  (Oreskes and Conway 2010: 236). The irony being that the same techniques of disinformation once used by Soviet Com- munists were now being used by the right-wing defenders of American liberty, who embraced free market capitalism above all.  People who had begun their careers as fact-finders,  they observed,  ended them as fact fighters  (Oreskes and Conway 2004: 238). What caused this apparent flip in loyalty to truth? How was it possible to use similar knowledge (or anti-knowledge) practices to achieve seemingly contra- dictory ends? Oreskes and Conway dubbed this the  Orwellian Problem. </p>
<p><em>Merchants of Doubt</em> made a huge splash, selling far more than the average aca- demic book, and having been cited, to date, nearly 3,000 times. Yet, it was not roundly embraced by STS practitioners. As one critic charged, despite their rigor- ous excavation of the perversion of expertise by merchants of doubt, Oreskes  and Conway s defense of the consensus around climate change was tantamount to serv- ing as  scientific establishment publicist[s]  (Fuller 2017). The implication was that Oreskes and Conway, having chosen to take a political stand vis- -vis contemporary science rather than upholding the kind of skepticism about science implied by the principle of symmetry, were undermining the methodological core of STS. In this particular view, their so-called  normative defense of expertise  that climate sci- entists  facts were certain and therefore an appropriate basis for political action made them a risk to the profession (Fuller 2017).</p>
<p>It is tempting to view Crichton, who has never been regarded as part of the pro- fession, as a mere extension of the enterprise documented in <em>Merchants of Doubt</em>, another data point in a damning account of disinformation (Powell 2011: 33 35). However, I argue that dismissing Crichton as a science denialist and <em>State of Fear</em> as mere evidence of the  Orwellian Problem  short-circuits the potential to recover an uncomfortable, but no less real, strand of the history of STS, one which stands in ironic relation to the very critiques leveraged against Oreskes and Conway.</p>
<p>It is not often appreciated that Crichton, despite his reputation as an author of mass market technothrillers, read widely in the history of science and STS and made his career through his skill at demonstrating what Bruno Latour (1987) called  science-in-the-making.  In the late 1960s, he participated in some of the earliest federally-funded programs to study the relationship between science and society (Aronova 2012) and became a patron of critical medical anthropology at Harvard, which has made crucial contributions to STS.<sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-4' name='ref-footnote-4'>4</a></sup> Whether or not STS scholars have noticed, Crichton s work, which has been described as  knowledge fiction  (McGil- ligan 1979), has always been preoccupied with some of the very same questions, and has used and even anticipated many of their methods (Radin 2019). While my approach may seem to take Crichton more seriously than an author of fiction should be, that is precisely the point. And, as I will show, many in positions of power have done just that.</p>
<p><strong><em>State of Fear</em> as Climate Meta-Fiction</strong></p>
<p>The plot of <em>State of Fear</em> revolves around the actions of a fictional Los Angeles phi- lanthropist, Nicholas Drake, who like the real celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio (he gets a shout out in the novel) has committed himself to environmentalist causes. In his employ is a young lawyer named Peter Evans, through whose eyes readers are meant to reconsider what they think they know about anthropogenic climate change. When Drake mysteriously disappears, Evans finds himself drawn into a dark underworld in which environmentalists will stop at nothing including fudging scientific data and planning to geo-engineer a devastating tsunami in order to keep resources flowing to their cause. Ecoterrorism, a form of fear-mongering which was much in the news at the turn of the  21st century (see Wagner 2008; Smith 2008; Beck 2007), is pre- sented in the novel as a tactic designed to silence skepticism about whether climate change deserved to be high on the political agenda.</p>
<p>At the core of <em>State of Fear</em> s argument is a scathing critique of what one char- acter, an Emeritus Professor of  media ecology  and the novel s Cassandra, calls the  Politico-legal-media complex  or PLM. The PLM is a meta-fictional mutation of Eisenhower s  academic-military-industrial complex,  the set of institutions that bolstered American authority and its pursuit of freedom during the Cold War (e.g., Wolfe 2018). Crichton s Professor, who has been marginalized within the Academy for his now unpopular views, insists human-induced climate change is one among many conspiracies (from DDT to silicone breast implants) created to transform post- Cold War America into a  state of fear.   I m telling you,  the Professor pleads at the climax of the novel,  <em>this is the way modern society works</em> by the constant creation of fear. And [in a political culture that valorizes free speech] there is no countervailing force  (Crichton 2004: 501).</p>
<p>Crichton s Professor draws upon a robust scholarly literature in the sociology of risk to make his argument, casting social science work inspired by the lived experi- ence of risk as having contributed to compromising the integrity of so-called natural science (not unlike the perpetrators of  Sokal Squared ). An annotated bibliogra- phy at the end of the novel includes citations to scholarship by Ulrich Beck (1992), Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (2000), and Frank Furedi (2002) all aca- demics whose work is distinguished by its attention to the mechanics of how risk and fear organize political activity in late modern Euro-American culture. Writing in 2004, the year <em>State of Fear</em> was published, historian Corey Robin observed that  though fear has politics, we often ignore or misconstrue it. Convinced that we lack moral or political principles to bind us together we savor the experience of being afraid,  as  many  writers  did  after  9/11   (Robin  2004:  3).  Crichton s  critique  of environmentalists  use of terrorism, and his appropriation of academic scholarship on risk and fear, can be read as an effort to highlight the <em>political</em> uses (or in his view, mis-uses) of fear  to teach us the worth of specific political values  (Robin 2004: 4) such as regulation (or resistance to regulation) of industrial pollution. It is for this reason that <em>State of Fear</em> was dubbed by one reviewer as  the first neo-con novel  (Wasserman 2004).</p>
<p>From another perspective, but for similar reasons, Crichton s decision to wade into the middle of a raging controversy over scientists  ability to predict the future of climate and to do so via a paperback you could buy at the airport made it, in the opinion of STS scholar and literary theorist Adam Trexler (2015: 35),  the most important climate change novel yet.  Trexler did not regard <em>State of Fear</em> as a piece of science denialism but rather a meta-fictional commentary on the politics of truth, which distinguished it from other works in the sub-genre, recently referred to as cli- mate fiction or  cli-fi  (Clark 2013; Marshall 2014; Ullrich 2015; Milkoreit 2016).</p>
<p>The apotheosis of cli-fi is more often credited to feminist dystopian novelist, Margaret Atwood. Notably, those who see Atwood as the progenitor of this genre including John Joseph Adams, the editor of a recent anthology of climate fiction value the ability of cli-fi  to serve as a warning flare, to illustrate the kinds of things we can expect if climate change goes unchecked, but also some of the possible solu- tions, to inspire the hope that we can maybe still do something before it s too late.  For Adams, fiction is a resource to  humanize and illuminate the issue in ways that aren t as easy to do with only science and cold equations  (Adams 2015: xii).</p>
<p>Arguably, Crichton sought to do the same, to humanize and illuminate but on very different terms. Take, for example, his depiction of an exchange between phi- lanthropist, Nicholas Drake, and a Scandinavian scientist, Per Einarsson. Einarsson is attempting to publish a paper that Drake believes undermines the narrative about melting glaciers as a result of anthropogenic climate change. Drake asks him to  consider the realities  and frame his study in terms of  recent extremes in climate variability  that do not disrupt the dominant narrative about global climate change:</p>
<p><code></code>You are not!  Einarsson said, pounding the table again.  The reality is that you do <em>not</em> want me to publish! </p>
<p><code></code>Now Per  </p>
<p><code></code>The  <em>reality</em>,  he said,  is that in Iceland the first half of the twentieth cen- tury was warmer than the second half, as in Greenland.*<sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-5' name='ref-footnote-5'>5</a></sup> The <em>reality</em> is that in Iceland, most glaciers lost mass after 1930 because summers warmed by .6 degrees Celsius, but since then the climate has become colder. The <em>real- ity</em> is that since 1970 these glaciers have been steadily advancing. They have regained half the ground that was lost earlier. Right now, eleven are surging. That is <em>the reality,</em> Nicholas! And I will not lie about it! </p>
<p>When Drake responds that he was  merely discussing how you word your paper,  Einarsson suggests that Drake s wording is an approach  that twists the truth!  (Crichton 2004: 47 48). As the argument continues, Einarsson insists that pre- senting this local data, specific to Greenland, in the service of a political narrative about destructive global climate change would undermine his credibility within the scientific community.</p>
<p><code></code>They will laugh at me and call me compromised,  Einarsson insists,  They will say I did it for grants,  he insists.  How the information is used is not my concern. My concern is to report the truth as best I can. </p>
<p>To which Drake replies,</p>
<p><code></code>We must all be aware that there are disinformation groups funded by indus- try petroleum, automotive who will seize on the report that some gla- ciers are growing, and use it to argue against global warming. That is what they always do. They snatch at anything to paint a false picture. </p>
<p>Drake concludes that Einarsson s disinterested relationship to truth is  Very noble . . . Perhaps not so practical  (Crichton 2004: 49).</p>
<p>At this moment, early in the novel, the reader is inclined to regard Drake s environmentalism as a force for good and to reflect on the moral and epistemo- logical responsibility of the scientist in contributing to political action. It is not until the end of the novel that Drake is revealed to be the most dangerous agent of disinformation of all, directing an ecoterrorist enterprise designed to stoke fear about climate change. Einarsson s rage is thus revealed not as the folly of politi- cal-disengaged science but a virtuous refusal to compromise the purity and truth of his enterprise.</p>
<p>Nearly 600 pages later, <em>State of Fear</em> concludes with an  Author s Message  that appears to break the proverbial fourth wall and lay bare Crichton s personal reasons for writing the book, a suspicion of scientific consensus, which I will discuss below. His message for readers is this:  Everyone has an agenda. Except me  (Crichton 2004: 630). This statement is both true and false. True if you view <em>State of Fear</em> as merely a form of entertainment with no political influence. False if you view the book as a piece of science communication. True <em>and</em> false if you can see the novel, as I am suggesting it needs to be seen, as both and more.</p>
<p>For instance, in <em>State of Fear</em>, in addition to deploying factish (Latour 1987, 2010) techniques like charts and graphs representing data extracted from actual NOAA databases, footnotes from published scientific papers, and an annotated bibliography that includes a range of scientific and social scientific books and articles Crichton also includes a non-fictional appendix. Intended to shape his readers  understanding of his use of facts, this appendix is titled  Why Politicized Science is Dangerous  and begins:</p>
<p><code></code>Imagine that there is a new scientific theory that warns of an impending crisis and points to a way out. </p>
<p><code></code>This theory quickly draws support from leading scientists, politicians, and celebrities around the world. Research is funded by distinguished philanthro- pies and carried out at prestigious universities. The crisis is reported frequently in the media. The science is taught in college and high school classrooms. </p>
<p><code></code>I don t mean global warming. I m talking about another theory, which rose to prominence a century ago  (Crichton 2004: 631).</p>
<p>He then presents a short history of the American eugenics movement, followed by a second short history of Lysenkoism. If the novel s plot painted environmentalists as eco-terrorists who manipulated scientific data to serve their own political ends, this appendix sought to show how history would prove them to have been peddling  pseudo-science  (Crichton 2004: 632). Crichton casts fear-mongering environmen- talists as the disinformation agents, peddling politicized facts, while attempting to solidify his position as a neutral defender and not a denier of science, observing at the conclusion to the Appendix that science is  the only hope to emerge from what Carl Sagan called  the demon haunted world of our past   (Crichton 2004: 637). Despite Crichton s acknowledgment of the epistemic authority of eugenics and Lysenkoism in their own times, his view of science, as one straining towards a more truthful future, betrays a core tenant of the principle of symmetry, that the science of today is any less socially-constructed than that of any other (Gordin 2012).</p>
<p>By comparison, in their documentation of the tobacco industry s success in man- ufacturing debate to deflect attention from the demonstrated risks of cancer in the 1950s, Oreskes and Conway showed that merchants of doubt sought to  stress to the media their responsibility to provide a  balanced presentation of all the facts  to ensure the public was not needlessly frightened  (Oreskes and Conway  2010: 16). Their approach was to use archival research to demonstrate how merchants of doubt, years before a principle of symmetry was even articulated for the academic sociol- ogy of scientific knowledge, produced claims that, while untrue, could masquerade as alternatives to facts. Oreskes and Conway argued that the use of fear was justi- fied when it was deployed to convey a scientific consensus that identified a threat to human flourishing. The imperative to take political action, their approach seemed to suggest, trumped methodological and epistemic conservativism.<sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-6' name='ref-footnote-6'>6</a></sup> Not unlike Crich- ton, but with different goals, Oreskes and Conway s historical analysis also operated in the service of a vision of science in which truth would ultimately triumph over disinformation. And not unlike Crichton, the use of fear functioned as a powerful rhetorical strategy in support of that vision.</p>
<p><strong>States of Facts and Fears</strong></p>
<p>One of the distinctive features of fiction is its ability to unabashedly and unapolo- getically appeal to emotions of all kinds. Literary scholar Sianne Ngai has called attention  to  the  politically  ambiguous  work  of  negative  emotions   (2005:  6) More than identifying so-called  ugly emotions  as useful sites of criticism, Ngai points out that many such emotions often present themselves ironically, provok- ing a  meta-response  that has the effect of producing in the reader  an unpleas- urable feeling about feeling  (2005: 10). This was the experience Crichton engi- neered for readers of <em>State of Fear</em>. While the novel contains plenty of thrills, his particular use of emotion is designed to produce an ironic distance that allows the reader to consider what it feels like to fear <em>the uses</em> of fear. It is in this sense that <em>State of Fear</em> can be understood to perform its own argument, destabilizing readers  sense of trust of climate science by making them consider whether the primary social role of facts is to manipulate emotions rather than reflect truth of nature. Indeed, STS scholars have shown that scientists  own engagements with science fiction have oriented science in ways that ideologically resonate with a politics of fear, a kind of emotional terrorism that can have epistemological con- sequences. For instance, Felicity Mellor s (2007) account of 1980s research on the threat of asteroid impact revealed that scientists  predilection for militaristic fictional narratives grounded their predictions in a subjective state of fear with explicit political consequences.</p>
<p><em>State of Fear,</em> published in time for the winter holidays at the end of 2004, entered a media landscape shaped by the release, earlier that year, of the blockbuster cli-fi film <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em>. The movie, based on an AM Radio duo s book, <em>The Coming Global Superstorm</em>, depicted dramatic planetary effects including devas- tating sea level rise, tornados, hurricanes, and hail storms immediately following the collapse of the Larsen Ice Shelf in Antarctica (Bell and Strieber 2004). This film received significant attention from science and risk communication scholars (Leis- erowitz 2004; Norton and Leaman 2004: Lowe et al. 2006). A national survey con- cluded that those who saw the film subsequently  [had] higher levels of concern and worry about global warming  even though the authors of the study observed that at the time  global warming is a rarely reported issue . . . and remains a low environ- mental priority for most Americans  (Leiserowitz 2004).</p>
<p>The widely circulating print news daily <em>USA Today</em> featured a range of coverage of scientific reactions to <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em>. While some scientists criticized the film s accuracy, they praised the filmmakers for raising awareness about climate change (Bowles 2004). Others, such as Patrick J. Michaels (2004), an environmen- tal scientist who rejected the consensus view on human-induced climate change, angrily characterized the film as climate change  propaganda.  The film was even discussed in the pages of <em>Science</em>, addressing concern about its impact on  public opinion  regarding climate change: a letter by an international team of researchers concluded that  the data   suggest that seeing an entertaining if exaggerated illus- tration of the possible effects of climate change succeeds, in just 125 minutes, in raising public concern but at the price of reducing public understanding  (Balm- ford et al. 2004). This expresses a phenomenon that has been described by commu- nication scholars as  perceived realism,  in which compelling narratives can make </p>
<p>less than compelling or accurate data feel true (Busselle and Bilandzic 2008; also Dahlstrom and Ho 2012).<sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-7' name='ref-footnote-7'>7</a></sup></p>
<p><em>State of Fear</em>, which deployed strategies discussed above to create a perception of realism with a different message than <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em>, was received by many scientists as a dangerous performance of neo-conservative efforts to under- mine science and democracy. Scientists and environmental organizations responded to the novel with outrage.<sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-8' name='ref-footnote-8'>8</a></sup> A reporter for <em>The New Republic</em> observed that:</p>
<p>Crichton s oeuvre has promoted, for an audience of millions, a damning cri- tique  of  expertise.  And  the  Bush  administration  has  put  this  critique  into action,  trampling  the  opinions  of  government  scientists,  exorcising  trained economists, muzzling the press, and stifling State Department wonks. Crich- ton, in other words, primed America for the Bush era (Crowley 2006).</p>
<p>When U.S. Vice President Al Gore lost the 2004 presidential election to George W. Bush, he cast himself as a defender of expertise and of science. His graph- filled multimedia presentation, <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>, which cited a 2004 article by Oreskes,  The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change,  published in <em>Science</em>, would earn him the Nobel Peace Prize (Gore 2006). It would also lead him to be blamed for making climate change a partisan issue (Nisbet 2009; McCright and Dunlap 2011).</p>
<p><em>State of Fear</em> s most ardent supporters were Al Gore s fiercest detractors. The novel found its way into the hands of policymakers such as James Inhofe, a long- serving Republican Senator from Oklahoma who regarded it as a defense of real- ity. Shortly after the publication of <em>State of Fear</em>, Inhofe invited Crichton to testify before Congress about the relationship between science and politics in the context of human-induced climate change, which Inhofe (2005) had taken to calling  the great- est hoax perpetrated against the American people.  <sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-9' name='ref-footnote-9'>9</a></sup> Invoking Crichton s credentials as a  doctor  (he received an MD from Harvard but never practiced medicine) and a  scientist  (he had not worked near a lab since a 1969 stint at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, CA), Inhofe praised him for  very cleverly weav[ing] a compelling presenta- tion of the scientific facts of climate change with ample footnotes and documenta- tion throughout into a gripping plot. </p>
<p>In Inhofe s (2005) own comments before the Senate, he reproduced the argu- ments from a speech Crichton had made at the Commonwealth Club of San Fran- cisco (2003) and the novel itself, namely, that  man-induced global warming is an article of religious faith.  Inhofe concluded his remarks by recommending <em>State of Fear</em> to his fellow Congressional legislators. Crichton was even invited by Karl Rove for an hour-long meeting with George W. Bush, after which it was reported the two men were  in near-total agreement  (Crowley 2006).</p>
<p>Oreskes was also among those who responded publicly to <em>State of Fear.</em> In a review in the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> titled  Fear-Mongering Crichton Wrong on  Science   (Oreskes  2005),  she  argued  that  Crichton  is  a  novelist,  and  he knows how to write fiction. But he should leave the scientific facts to the sci- entists, the historical facts to historians and the politics to all of us to debate  (Oreskes 2005). There is fear in her statement that the use of facts in fictional contexts could compromise efforts to introduce regulation intended to stem cli- mate change. Given the uptake of <em>State of Fear</em> by Republican politicians like Inhofe, who regarded it as a plausible argument for rejecting the reality of climate change, Oreskes  fear was warranted.</p>
<p>Ironically, the championing of scientific expertise by Al Gore demonstrated how facts that seemed profoundly robust and credible, including those summa- rized by Oreskes, could be undermined and even outright dismissed as liberal fear-mongering. Remember, this was similar to the strategy of Oreskes and Con- way s merchants of doubt but also Crichton s corrupt environmentalist, Drake, in their arguments that Rachel Carson s <em>Silent Spring</em> was a piece of fear-mon- gering disinformation. Oreskes, in her 2005 review of <em>State of Fear</em>, was effec- tively calling Crichton out for the same kind of emotional manipulation stoking fear (though in his case, fear about the use of fear itself) he had critiqued envi- ronmentalists for doing in their collusion with the PLM, the political-legal-media complex.</p>
<p>Adam Trexler s (2015) interpretation of <em>State of Fear</em> offers one explanation for the double-edged risk of Oreskes  strategy of defending expertise by doubling down on scientific consensus. He argues that many of the novel s most vociferous critics  badly misread Crichton s investments towards science  (Trexler 2015: 36). Rather, as a work of fiction, Trexler suggests it is possible to regard <em>State of Fear</em> as a demonstration of how both postmodernism and realism can be adapted to skepticism of climate change rather easily (Trexler 2015: 34). As Crichton himself argued in a 2003 lecture at Caltech, it was the very idea of consensus the epistemic convention that Oreskes and Conway argued legitimated their use of fear that was  an extremely pernicious development.  Tacitly invoking the ethos of symmetry (promoted by Fuller 2016, 2017; Collins et al. 2017), Crichton drew on the history of science to argue that  the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled . . . There is no such thing as consensus science. If it s consensus, it isn t science. If it s science, it isn t consensus. Period. </p>
<p>Oreskes and Conway s subsequent careful historical analysis of how merchants of doubt deployed similar, so-called postmodern techniques to produce alterna- tive facts published in the Obama era could not ultimately persuade those who had been primed to see such a project as precisely the kind of move liberal, envi- ronmentalist academics would make. Their recourse to consensus among experts had already and ironically been cast as a form of spin, the  refuge of scoundrels  (Crichton 2003a, 2003b).</p>
<p><strong>Plot Twists and Fear, Itself</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps this is why a decade after the publication of <em>State of Fear</em>, and five years after <em>Merchants of Doubt</em> was made into a documentary film, Oreskes and Con- way (2014) were motivated to take a page out of Crichton s playbook, publishing their own piece of climate fiction, titled <em>The Collapse of Western Civilization: A View From the Future.</em> The plot of the book departs from the apocalyptic scenario depicted in the 2004 film, <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em>, in which the West Antarctic ice sheet collapses, causing massive sea level rises that cause a domino effect, ulti- mately leading to the collapse of social and political institutions.<sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-10' name='ref-footnote-10'>10</a></sup> It is narrated by a Chinese historian of the future of 2093, who reflects on the failings of scientists to mobilize social change in response to scientific data. According to the publish- er s description of the book on the website of Columbia University Press:</p>
<p>In this haunting, provocative work of science-based fiction, Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway imagine a world devastated by climate change. <em>Dram- atizing the science in ways traditional nonfiction cannot</em>, the book reasserts the importance of scientists and the work they do and reveals the self-serv- ing interests of the so called  carbon combustion complex  that have turned the practice of science into political fodder. Based on sound scholarship and yet unafraid to speak boldly, this book provides a welcome moment of clarity amid the cacophony of climate change literature.<sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-11' name='ref-footnote-11'>11</a></sup></p>
<p>This work of  science-based fiction  was blurbed by science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson, who twice invoked plausibility as praise:  Oreskes and Con- way s startling and all-too-plausible history of the century to come is in the spirit of George Orwell and Aldous Huxley and all the writers who have turned to prophecy in the attempt to ward off an oncoming disaster. Witty in its details and disturbing in its plausibility, this is an account of the Long Emergency we re entering that you will not soon forget.  Oreskes and Conway s publisher also obtained a blurb from a member of Congress:  A chilling view of what our history could be. Ignore it and it becomes more likely. Read this book, heed its warning, and perhaps we can avoid its dire predictions  (Timothy Wirth, vice chairman, United Nations Foundation, and former U.S. Senator and Member, U.S. House of Representatives).</p>
<p><em>The Collapse of Western Civilization</em> received attention, like <em>State of Fear</em>, in scientific publications as well as the fiction book review sections of popular news media, many of which emphasized how scary it was. Writing for <em>The New York Times</em>,  critic  Nathaniel  Rich  (2014)  described  the  work s  fear-inducing  effects, observing  that   the  simple  act  of  writing  about  the  present  in  the  past  tense makes their account of our current situation even more chilling than their imagined future.  <em>Mother Jones</em> ran a review by Chris Mooney (2014), a journalist with strong </p>
<p>interests in both science communication and  climate change,  with the  headline,  Two historians turn to science fiction to scare the hell out of you about climate change. </p>
<p>In his piece, Mooney (2014) quoted Oreskes, who had elsewhere commented on why she and Conway turned to fiction. There, she explained that they  felt like we really understood the science, but we also felt that the scientific community had really not explained why any of this mattered. And we just kept coming back to this idea of, how do we really talk about why this matters, and not just for polar bears, and not just for people living in far flung places, but what s really at stake  (Oreskes cited in Mooney 2014).</p>
<p>Oreskes and Conway s fiction, then, was perhaps a strategic concession to the reality that the facts and even facts about how those facts got made could not speak for themselves, that speculative fiction might be a more effective strategy for calling into question the  epistemic conventions  of the present (Coen 2014). Oreskes justified her and Conway s turn to fiction in this way, not necessarily to compete with authors like Crichton but by observing scientists  tendency to  hew to a 95% confidence limit that has led to extreme overcaution  (Oreskes cited in Mooney 2014). This sentiment is echoed in their novel. Scientists   desire to dem- onstrate  disciplinary  severity,   Oreskes  and  Conway s  fictional  historical  narra- tor recounts, led them to build  an intellectual culture based on the premise that it was worse to fool oneself into believing in something that did not exist than not to believe in something that did  (Oreskes and Conway 2014: 17). Crichton seized upon this as well. In the passage I transcribed above, his fictional scientist, Einars- son was chastised by environmentalist Drake for being too conservative refusing to be  practical  in allowing his data to be differently contextualized by non-scien- tists in the service of political action.</p>
<p>The difference is that Crichton, unlike Oreskes and Conway, remained commit- ted to an ideal of science that rejected what Bruno Latour (2004) argued for in the same year <em>State of Fear</em> was released: the need for STS scholars and allied academ- ics to shift from a preoccupation with mere matters of fact to matters of concern. Latour s reason for emphasizing this shift was his observation that a new generation of STS scholars and critical theorists seemed unprepared to respond to political con- testations over science, climate science in particular. In this piece, titled  Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam?  Latour expressed his own concern that the tools of deconstruction, so valuable to early STS in their studies of the social construction of facts, had begun to be weaponized in ways that provoked the need for a reassessment of the field s commitment to symmetry and its aversion to political action.</p>
<p>In an interview associated with the release of <em>State of Fear</em> by a <em>New York Times</em> science writer, Crichton  insisted that scientists trying to divine where conditions will be in coming decades face huge hurdles. [He explained]  There s a lot of people in modern society who really think they can see the future; they don t think they re psychics, but they think they can see the future. And boy, they can t   (Revkin 2004). Crichton could not see the future either, but he was skilled at its colonization (Radin 2019). If not a paid merchant of doubt, Crichton was certainly a peddler, using his fiction to scare readers by literally selling the idea that fear was an illegitimate </p>
<p>political motivator in the realm of science.<sup class='md-footnote'><a href='#dfref-footnote-12' name='ref-footnote-12'>12</a></sup> What made Crichton s work so sub- versive was that, by attending to the politics of knowledge and deploying STS tech- niques himself, he demonstrated the legitimacy of Latour s (2004) anxiety about matters of fact. At the same time, he also anticipated the precise tactics Oreskes and Conway were driven to employ, out of their own fears about the integrity of science and scientists  responsibilities in a democratic society.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Towards a Reflexive History of STS</strong></p>
<p>This paper has been a historical case study in polyvalent uses of STS practices across the genres of fact and fiction as well as the political spectrum in the decades since the Science Wars. In creating multiple alternative worlds (ones that sometimes very closely resemble our own), fiction creates multiple  ontologies  of facts (Howe 2017). With <em>State of Fear</em>, Crichton created a fictional world of alternative facts which his fans, as well as his critics, reproduced and amplified with material effects on the politics of knowledge regarding climate change. Oreskes and Conway simi- larly reached for fiction in order to amplify facts, but only a decade after Oreskes  insistence that fiction and science be kept in separate domains (Oreskes 2005).</p>
<p>What this history shows is that Crichton as well as Oreskes and Conway drew on similar practices, albeit with different ideas about the relationship between science and social action. Each sought to make an STS-inspired commentary on the nature of knowledge and each effectively accused the other of fear-mongering as a primary strategy for defending a particular view of reality. However, the difference between Crichton and Oreskes and Conway is not, ultimately, a matter of genre, or even sym- metry, it is a matter of accountability.</p>
<p>Crichton claims at the end of <em>State of Fear</em> that  Everyone has an agenda. Except me,  though his actions following the publication of his book testifying before Congress, meeting with the President s senior advisor suggest otherwise (Crich- ton 2004: 630). Oreskes and Conway made their agenda explicit in the non-fictional <em>Merchants of Doubt</em> and in the fictional <em>The Collapse of Western Civilization</em>: to counter efforts to render scientific consensus on climate change unreliable. Crichton suggested that anyone with an agenda was, by definition, not objective and therefore not reliable even as he gave public lectures denouncing the concept of consensus. Such a position depends on a popular understanding of objectivity as a view from nowhere, one in which facts speak for themselves. Yet, as Lorraine Daston and Peter Galison have shown (1994, 2007), objectivity is as much a moral ideal as an epis- temic one.</p>
<p>The reason to be suspicious of Crichton s depiction of reality, then, is not that it comes to us via the genre of fiction, but precisely because he wished it to be received as self-evident and politically neutral. The power of a reflexive history of STS is that it allows us to ask not whether he was right or wrong, but why his agenda was to have no agenda: to whom were his claims about the nature of credibility regarded as credible? In other words, it allows us to consider the social history of methodologi- cal imperatives like symmetry and the ways an insistence on its primacy have fore- closed other questions about what it means to be a reliable knower or practitioner, even of STS itself.</p>
<p>The importance of asking what it means to be a reliable knower would not be lost on Oreskes. Her 1996 essay,  Objectivity or Heroism: On the Invisibility of Women in the History of Science  has been cited far fewer times than  <em>Merchants of Doubt</em>. However, it is a piece of scholarship that examines structural reasons why facts do not, in fact, speak for themselves. Their reception, she argues, is always mediated by the status of the knower the circumstances in which that knower makes claims. Drawing on then cutting-edge scholarship in feminist philosophy of science schol- arship whose edge remains razor sharp, perhaps from under-use in certain corners of the Academy (i.e., Keller 1982; Rose 1983; Harding 1986; Longino 1987; Haraway 1988; Traweek 2009) Oreskes encouraged suspicion of heroic figures in the realm of science, in particular those who obscured or denied the complex forms of collec- tivity and politics that go into making reliable knowledge.</p>
<p>And it is this tradition, of situated, feminist approaches to evaluating knowers and their claims that Oreskes mobilized (Baker and Oreskes 2017) in her recent co-authored rejoinder to the charge that in her climate science advocacy she had abandoned her methodological commitments to STS (Fuller 2017). As I have been attempting to demonstrate, within the history of STS one that focuses on practices as they travel within but also far beyond the Academy there are resources for iden- tifying what kinds of knowledge is indeed worth knowing and for undertaking anal- ysis of episodes where STS itself has been used to adjudicate what counts as reliable knowledge.</p>
<p>There are also resources within the history of STS for thinking differently about what it means to put its concepts into practice. Doing so necessarily involves reflex- ive but also reparative examination of epistemic conventions, suggesting that what STS has been need not be wholly consistent with what it is becoming (Simmons 2016). STS is a dynamic and heterogeneous field, one that in its emerging queer, decolonial, and anti-racist modes has continued, like its feminist forerunners, to pro- vincialize methodological orthodoxies in order to admit a broader range of knowers to its own ranks (a highly abbreviated accounting includes: Benjamin 2013; Tall- Bear 2013; Todd 2016).</p>
<p>The sustained value of STS depends seeing its history as part of its present not merely as what came before, or even as a broader project reckoning with what it means to be a reliable knower, but also taking into account the history of STS prac- titioners  ideas about the future of the field, itself. It means staying committed to a view of science and its social study as complex, collective, contingent, and impure undertakings, even in a moment when the methods used to affirm those very quali- ties appear to have been used against certain practitioners  visions. It also means, then, expanding analytic frames to attend to uses of STS that provoke discomfort or even fear. Most of all it means honestly examining one s own motivations for understanding the place and power of knowledge. I hope that my students will find in a reflexive history of STS a means for facing the complex and layered reality of  alternative facts.  Rather than be ruled by fear, such an approach can help them respond to political uses of fear and facts not only with concern but with care (Mar- tin et al. 2015; de la Bellacasa 2017).</p>
