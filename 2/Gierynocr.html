<p>THOMAS F. GIERYN <em>Indiana University</em> </p>
<p><em>The demarcation of science from other intellectual activities-long an</em> analytic <em>problem for philosophers and sociologists--is here examined as a</em> practical <em>problem for scientists. Construction of a boundary between science and varieties of non-science is useful for scientists&#39;  pursuit  of  professional  goals:  acquisition  of  intellectual   authority   and  career   opportunities;  denial   of   these   resources   to &quot; pseudos cientists&quot; ; and protection  of  the  autonomy  of  scientific  research  from  political  interference  .  &quot; Boundary-work&quot; describes an ideological style found in scientists&#39; attempts to create a public  image  for  science  by  contrasting  it  favorably  to  non-scientific  intellectual  or technical  activities.  Alternative  sets  of  characteristics  available  for  ideological attribution  to science reflect ambivalences or strains within the institution: science can be made to look empirical or theoretical, pure or applied. However, selection of one or another description depends on which characteristics best achieve the demarcation in a way  that  justifies  scientists&#39;  claims  to  authority  or  resources.  Thus,  &quot;science&quot;  is  no single  thing: its boundaries  are drawn  and  redrawn in flexible , historically changing and sometimes ambiguous ways.</em> </p>

They  are  symp  toms-as   1973:201).  Second,  Geertz  recommends  that well  as  symbolic   resolutions--of role strain,  sociologists  examine  the  <em>rhetorical  style</em>  of contradiction,  and  disequilibrium  (White,  1961;  ideological  statements  (cf.
