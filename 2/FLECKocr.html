<p>What is a fact? </p>
<p>A  fact  is  supposed  to  be  distinguished  from  transient theories as something definite, permanent, and independent of any subjective interpretation by the scientist. It is that which the various scientific disciplines aim at. The critique of the methods used to establish it constitutes the subject matter of epistemology. </p>
<p>Epistemology often commits a fundamental error: almost ex clusively it regards  well-established facts of everyday life, or those of classical physics, as the only ones that are reliable and worthy of investigation. Valuation based upon such  an  investigation  is  inherently  naive,  with  the  result that only superficial data are obtained. </p>
<p>Moreover, we have even lost any critical insight we may once </p>
<p>have had into the organic basis of perception, taking for granted the basic fact that a normal person has two eyes. We have nearly ceased to consider this as even knowledge at all and are no longer conscious of our own participation in perception. Instead, we feel a complete  passivity in the face of a power that is independent of us; a power we call </p>
<p>&quot;existence&quot;  or  &quot;reality.&quot;  In  this  respect  we  behave  like someone  who  daily  performs  ritual  or  habitual  actions mechan  ically.  These  are  no  longer  voluntary  activities, </p>
