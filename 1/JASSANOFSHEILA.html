<p>Abstract and Keywords</p>
<p>This chapter presents science and technology studies (STS) as a new island in a preexist­ ing disciplinary archipelago. As a field, STS combines two strands of work dealing, re­ spectively, with the nature and practices of science and technology (S&amp;T) and the rela­ tionships between science, technology, and society. As such, STS research focuses on dis­ tinctive objects of inquiry and employs novel discourses and methods. The field confronts three significant barriers to achieving greater intellectual coherence, and institutional recognition. First, it must persuade skeptical scientists and university administrators of the need for a critical perspective on S&amp;T. Second, it must demonstrate that traditional disciplines do not adequately analyze S&amp;T. Third, it has to overcome STS scholars’ reluc­ tance to create intellectual boundaries and membership criteria that appear to exclude innovative work. A generation of scholars with graduate degrees in STS are helping to meet these challenges.</p>

<p>IN 2001, science and technology studies (STS) made an appearance as a card-carrying field in the <em>International Encyclopedia of Social and Behavioral Sciences</em> or <em>IESBS</em> <a href='#page17'>(Smelser &amp; Baltes 2001)</a>. This validated years of effort by many scholars to establish the social studies of science and technology as a recognized, and recognizable, domain of in­ tellectual activity. As a member of that network and as the editor of the <em>IESBS</em> section on STS, I was understandably elated, even though putting the section together entailed many difficult and unforeseen choices of what to include or exclude in defining the field.<a href='#page17'>1</a> Even then, STS was not counted as a discipline, a label reserved for fields with well-es­ tablished, one-word names (e.g., anthropology, economics, history, law, philosophy), and for branches of psychology. Instead, STS was classified as an “intersecting field,” a rubric shared with a cluster of relatively recent, amorphous, and ill-assorted domains of study such as genetics and society, gender studies, religious studies, and behavioral and cogni­ tive neuroscience. Unlike media studies or public policy however, STS was not demoted to</p>

<p>the status of “application.” It took its place in the roster of the social sciences as a well-demarcated territory on the map of knowledge.</p>
<p>This review asks what major contributions STS has made to research and teaching, and what have been its principal successes and failures inside and outside academia. How does the future look for STS? Responses to these questions help shed light on the mean­ ings and challenges of interdisciplinarity, illuminating the potential that spaces between disciplines offer for novel constellations of inquiry to enhance human self-awareness, so­ cial understanding, and public action. At the same time, the track record of STS shows how difficult it is to populate those in-between spaces with well-trained scholars, new cur­ ricular offerings, and long-term research programs. At the heart of the story are ques­ tions about the capacity of STS to overcome entrenched status differentials among disci­ plines, especially between the humanistic social sciences and the powerful enterprises of university-based science, medicine, and engineering.</p>

<p>At the risk of oversimplification, and of flattening important cross-cultural differences, STS can be seen as a merger of two broad streams of mid-twentieth-century scholarship.<a href='#page17'>2</a> One looks at the <em>nature</em> and <em>practices</em> of science and technology (S&amp;T) as social institu­ tions possessing distinctive normative commitments, structures, practices, and discours­ es that nevertheless change over time and vary across cultural contexts. The other is mainly concerned with the <em>impacts</em> and <em>control</em> of science, and even more of technology, with particular focus on the risks that S&amp;T pose to human values such as health and safe­ ty, peace, security, privacy, community, democracy, development, and environmental sus­ tainability. The consolidation of STS at the beginning of the twenty-first century is largely a consequence of these once-discrete lines of concern coming together around a shared core of theoretical orientations, research methods, texts, and topics, undergirded by new professional infrastructures (e.g., programs, departments, textbooks, journals, societies). Thus, STS is the product of decades of effort by people who perceived important gaps in the academic analysis of S&amp;T, and who gradually, painstakingly, and with mixed success built institutional foundations to support the missing research and teaching.</p>
<p>The resulting field is interdisciplinary in a sense that can best be captured through a car­ tographic metaphor. Underlying the idea of interdisciplinarity are two ideal-typical maps of preexisting disciplines. In one, all the disciplines are tightly lined up, one against an­ other, as in a map of the contiguous United States, with shared boundaries and no gaps between; in the other, as in a map of the Indonesian archipelago, the disciplines are idio­ syncratically bounded islands, scattered across a sea of ignorance, with unexplored wa­ ters in between.<a href='#page17'>3 </a>On the first map, a new “interdiscipline” comes into being principally through exchanges among scholars belonging to one or another established disciplinary community and trained in its forms of reasoning and research practices. On the second, an “<em>inter</em>discipline” is literally that—an autonomous formation situated among other disci­ plines. Such a field may arise in response to new concerns in society, such as the perva­</p>

Science and</p>

<p>interstate highway construction among existing states than an attempt to chart new terri­ tories among islands of disciplined thought in the high seas of the unknown.</p>
<p>13.1.1 The Nature and Practices of Science and Technology</p>
<p>From the interwar period to the start of the Cold War, sociologists and historians, and not infrequently scientists, engineers, and social activists, became interested in the relation­ ship between scientific practice and its work products. Thomas Kuhn’s hugely influential <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> is a well-known example <a href='https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198733522.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198733522-e-9#oxfordhb-9780198733522-e-9-bibItem-174'>(Kuhn 1962</a>). Kuhn’s* work helped turn scholarly attention away from the theoretical content and coherence of scientific claims to the social means of their production. His book helped crystallize a new approach to the history of science in which scientific facts were seen as products of scien­ tists’ communal knowledge-generating efforts, conditioned by specific contexts of discov­ ery. This shift led to an effort by a group of mainly British scholars to probe how far ques­ tions about the nature of science once asked mainly by philosophers could be productive­ ly reframed as questions about how science works <a href='#page16'>(Bloor 1976)</a>. Their inquiries produced a distinctive school of “sociology of scientific knowledge” (SSK)<a href='#page17'>4 </a>located in centers for “science studies” at a number of UK universities, including Edinburgh and Bath, in the 1970s. The aim of SSK was more imperial than interdisciplinary: It was to render social what had previously been seen as mainly epistemic (how scientists think); it was to appro­ priate for the qualitative and interpretive social sciences what had once belonged to phi­ losophy (by asking what scientists do, how they do it, and how their work achieves au­ thority).</p>
<p>While SSK was emerging from struggles between philosophy and sociology of science, scholars from other backgrounds recognized the value of ethnographic methods for studying scientists at work. An early, influential exemplar of this approach was the 1979 book by Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar, <em>Laboratory Life: The Social Construction of Sci­</em> <em>entific Facts</em>; the word “social” was dropped from the 1986 edition. In this and subse­* quent writing, Latour urged students of science to “follow the scientist” if they wished to understand how observations in the lab or the field turn into facts <a href='#page16'>(Latour 1987</a>). Partici­ pant-observation proved a useful tool for exploring the cultural dynamics of different sci­ entific disciplines (physics, molecular biology, genomics, climate modeling) and organiza­ tions (“big science,” university laboratories, interdisciplinary research centers). Latour, together with his colleague Michel Callon, a sociologist of technology and, later, the mar­ ket in the Paris-based school of STS, also produced important works on the relations be­ tween the human and nonhuman or the social and material elements of S&amp;T. Their “actor-network theory” (ANT), which urges symmetrical treatment of human and nonhuman agents, known as “actants,” emerged as another salient direction in STS research. By</p>

<p>technology as an increasingly more significant object of STS study.</p>
<p>A third important research tradition looked at science and technology as distinctive cul­ tural formations. Engaging anthropologists, feminists, postcolonial scholars, discourse an­ alysts, and other theorists of language and power, this body of work crossed the line be­ tween the humanities and the social sciences, particularly in its preoccupation with the meanings people attach to the products of S&amp;T. In works such as <a href='#page16'>Donna Haraway’s</a></p>
<p><a href='#page16'>(1989) </a>investigations of primatology or <a href='#page16'>Evelyn Fox Keller’s (1986) </a>studies on gender and science, cultural studies of science and technology questioned how social power trans­ lates into scientific authority and vice versa. A flourishing body of scholarship emerged around medical S&amp;T, focusing on such topics as reproductive medicine, patient activism, and hereditary disease; unlike classical studies of the physical sciences and technologies, these more human-centered investigations emphasized themes of identity and subjectivi­ ty, especially of those affected by disease classifications. More generally, an influx of re­ search funds from the Human Genome Project spurred broad-based exploration of the ethical, legal, and social implications of genetics and genomics, contributing new norma­ tive dimensions to cultural studies of the life sciences and technologies. Less common but equally agenda-setting was work on the relations between science and other powerful in­ stitutions, such as law, politics, and religion; these works highlighted the impact of cultur­ al norms of legitimacy and reasonableness on the production and reception of policy-rele­ vant scientific facts (Jasanoff <a href='#page16'>1990, 2005)</a>.</p>
<p>13.1.2 The Invention of Technoscience</p>
<p>Unlike historians of science and of technology, who maintain separate identities through professional training and associations, STS scholars made a point of integrating their studies of scientific discovery with analyses of the technological systems that support or result from advances in science. The term “technoscience,” widely used in STS research and the name of the newsletter issued by the Society for Social Studies of Science (4S), signals a deep commitment to the view that S&amp;T are inextricably intertwined. STS schol­ arship asserts that technological innovation would not be possible without scientific prob­ lem-solving; in reverse, scientific discovery could not proceed without technologies to en­ able new experimental methods and approaches. Accordingly, in studying high-energy physics or molecular biology, bakelite or musical synthesizers, stem cells or Golden Rice, the Internet or the human genome, STS researchers pay particular attention to the inter­ play of ideas, instruments, and materials in the practices of the discoverers, inventors, and users of S&amp;T. By using the term “technoscience,” the field draws its own distinctive boundaries around the subject matter it investigates.</p>
<p>The third handbook of STS sponsored by the Society for Social Studies of Science, one of the field’s major professional societies (<a href='#page16'>Hackett et al. 2007; </a>for an earlier survey of the field, see <a href='#page16'>Jasanoff et al. 1995</a>) is illustrative. The handbook’s final section, headed “Emer­ gent Technosciences,” deals with systems that cross the lines between the cognitive and the material as well as the natural and the social. This section includes articles on ge­</p>

<p>depend on multifaceted engagement by actors ranging from individual discoverers, inven­ tors, and entrepreneurs to expert communities, economic sponsors, policy makers, and consuming (or sometimes resisting) publics.</p>
<p>13.1.3 Impacts and Control of Science and Technology</p>
<p>The second major thrust within STS derives from scientists’—and increasingly citizens’ and social movements’—concerns about the impacts of S&amp;T developments on health, safety, and fundamental human values. The dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and the ensuing nuclear arms race between the United States and the former Soviet Union initiated a new politics of technological anxiety. Themes of scien­ tists’ complicity in war and violence, and technology’s lack of democratic accountability, grew in prominence during the Vietnam War, which also helped link earlier worries about the ungovernability of science with nascent concerns about S&amp;T’s environmental implica­ tions. The marine biologist Rachel Carson’s book <a href='#page16'><em>Silent Spring</em> (Carson 1962), </a>an attack on indiscriminate chemical use widely credited with launching the modern US environ­ mental movement, appeared in the same year as Kuhn’s book on scientific revolutions. More recently, genetic, information, neuro-, and nanotechnologies, and their rapid con­ vergence in areas such as synthetic biology, have aroused new fears about risks to indi­ viduals and society. Observers question whether the benefits of these promising develop­ ments might be offset by erosions of liberty, privacy, autonomy, equality, and other cher­ ished liberal ideals. At the limit, questions have arisen about assaults on human nature it­ self, with the ascendance of the computer and associated forms of standardization and control into intimate bodily functions, social relationships, and autonomy of will and thought. Increasingly, too, the consequences of global imbalances in S&amp;T innovation, and their implications for human rights and social justice, have emerged as centers of gravity for STS scholarship and cross-national collaboration.</p>
<p>In the late 1960s, several US universities, including Cornell, Harvard, MIT, Penn State, and Stanford, reacted to these developments by forming programs in “science, technolo­ gy, and society” (also abbreviated as STS). Founded, and often led, by senior scientists or engineers—experienced in science advice and policy formation, these programs pre­ sumed that STS work had to be cross-disciplinary in the sense of highway-building de­ scribed above, engaging natural scientists and engineers, as well as humanists, social sci­ entists, and practitioners in law, business, and public policy. Preoccupied with social prob­ lem-solving, the founders of US STS programs presumed that good STS research de­ manded familiarity with the technical content of S&amp;T. This meant in turn that early contri­ butions to research and teaching were made by scientists (or ex-scientists) and engi­ neers, or by teams that included technically trained researchers. Humanists and social scientists were tacitly assumed to have no significant independent insights into the func­ tioning of S&amp;T, although their participation was considered essential for illuminating the “soft,” value-laden, societal dimensions of S&amp;T. Cornell’s STS program provides a small</p>

<p>marker of these attitudes and assumptions. It was established in 1969 by a chemist (Franklin Long), a physicist (Raymond Bowers), a biologist (Richard D. O’Brien), and a philosopher of language and mathematics (Max Black).</p>
<p>The prominent role of scientists and engineers helped establish the credibility of STS re­ search in its early years, but it also introduced several constraints: emphasis on empirical</p>
<p><img src="Aspose.Words.238a54b9-d97f-4d33-9f8a-9cceb23be694.007.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> case studies rather than social theory; reaffirmation of scientists’ necessarily par­</p>
<p>tial perceptions about the cultures and practices of S&amp;T; reliance on anecdotal practition­ er narratives rather than systematic research to explain science-technology-society rela­ tionships; and acceptance of public “scientific illiteracy” as the favored explanation for popular concerns about S&amp;T. The topics treated by first-generation STS scholars also re­ flected some of these limitations. Case studies of the public controversies of the day (air­ ports, nuclear power, supersonic transport, vaccines, environmental pollution) took cen­ ter stage, with results sometimes indistinguishable from robust journalism. More prob­ lematically, such research failed to win the interest of major scholars in established hu­ manistic or social scientific disciplines, and many STS programs in the United States, such as Harvard’s and Cornell’s, either died a quiet death or substantially lost momentum by the mid-1970s.</p>
<p>One should note too that STS scholars in the 1970s drew on fairly conventional social the­ ory to explain why science became political—for example, attributing technical controver­ sies to differences in participants’ taken-for-granted interests; hence they neither drew on nor contributed to seminal insights in other fields. At a time when many social sci­ ences were turning to quantitative methods and rational choice theory, it was easy to dis­ miss qualitative, case-specific STS findings as merely anecdotal or subjective. Unlike the scholars preoccupied with the practices of scientists, however, researchers focusing on the impact and control of S&amp;T were drawn from the first to issues of power and gover­ nance. Their work highlighted how dominant processes of technical decision-making tended to marginalize weaker social groups; neo-Marxist theorists tied these dynamics to class, capital, and hegemonic beliefs, whereas feminists argued that gendered power structures drove developments in S&amp;T. In these respects, even first-generation STS re­ search shared significant concerns with later sociocultural studies of S&amp;T. Openings ex­ isted for a productive synthesis, which began in the United States in the late 1980s under the increasingly common rubric of “science and technology studies.”</p>
<p>13.1.4 Common Ground</p>
<p>Convergence between the two major precursors of contemporary STS—work on the na­ ture of scientific production and on the impacts of S&amp;T—occurred on both intellectual and institutional levels. Maturing research programs brought scattered projects and prac­ titioners into closer communion and helped define common theoretical approaches and topical interests. In brief, research on the nature of science became more concerned with how social understandings or arrangements are taken up into the production of knowl­ edge and artifacts, while research on the impacts of S&amp;T recognized that the interactions of science and society begin long before the material products of technology enter the</p>

<p>market and affect lives. As a result, the power of S&amp;T was no longer seen as wholly sepa­ rable from other kinds of power. Nor were the formation and application of knowledge considered entirely distinct from their eventual uses and impacts. Thus, the ways in which science’s epistemic authority interpenetrates other kinds of social and psychologi­ cal authority emerged as a major thread in the field’s evolving agenda of inquiry.</p>
<p>By the end of the 1990s, a new generation of STS scholars began examining issues such as the following: the nature of expertise in various historical periods and cultural set­ tings; the resources used to forge agreement on “facts”; the relationship between scien­</p>
<p>tific <img src="Aspose.Words.238a54b9-d97f-4d33-9f8a-9cceb23be694.008.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> representations and wider visual culture; the disciplining effects of instru­</p>
<p>ments, measuring techniques, and administrative routines; the use of nonhuman agents, including model lab organisms such as flies or mice, in the work of science; the methods of maintaining or challenging boundaries between scientific, technological, and other cul­ tural practices; and the intermingling of expert and lay cultures around such issues as ge­ netic disease. The field’s long-standing concerns with fact, truth, and method did not van­ ish, but they “thickened” to include a new preoccupation with how novel ideas, entities, and belief systems appear and make their way in the world (and how old ones die out). More than simply accounting for “truth,” STS became concerned with the social dimen­ sions of the accreditation and diffusion of knowledge and its technological manifestations. There was also growing interest among STS scholars of all stripes in examining the rela­ tions between scientific and other modes of belief, expression, and power: law, literature, culture, religion, art. Science in non-Western contexts was a relatively late-blooming top­ ic, but was included in the 1995 STS handbook and thereafter grew into a significant fo­ cus on global S&amp;T.<a href='#page17'>5</a></p>
<p>With all of these projects on the rise, older disciplinary divisions no longer made much sense within STS, particularly in the training of young scholars. For example, since the field’s research questions centered on the nexus of knowledge and power, cutting across historical periods, budding STS scholars saw benefit from exposure to historiography as well as social theory, ethnography as well as metaphysics, and political as well as moral philosophy. The methods used by some of the best-known senior academics in the field were increasingly difficult to localize by discipline. Equally, the work they produced found its way across the field as a whole and into many neighboring disciplines. Science and technology studies books were reviewed in journals running from <em>Science</em> and <em>Nature</em> to the <em>New York Times Book Review</em> and the <em>Times Literary Supplement</em>, with the whole range of the field’s professional journals between. The unifying feature in all cases was the <em>subject</em> of study, namely, human investments in science and technology.</p>
<p>While many STS researchers could still be characterized as mainly anthropologists, histo­ rians, or sociologists, it seemed increasingly more appropriate to distinguish them in rela­ tion to their research fields and theoretical commitments. By the early years of the new century, it became less common to find mature STS scholars who defined themselves in terms of a “pure” discipline (history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology, politics, econom­ ics) applied to a single science or technology (biology, physics, chemistry, engineering, medicine, risk analysis). Textbooks introducing students to STS reflected this cross-disci­</p>

<p>To be sure, there was never a complete integration of assumptions and methods across the spectrum of STS, any more than there is between subfields within most traditional disciplines. Specialties endure and thrive, as in any disciplinary context. For example, boundary-spanning subjects such as risk, scientific evidence, bioethics, or the public un­ derstanding of science figure more prominently in the work of STS scholars descended</p>

<p>trast, historically or philosophically trained STS researchers have tended to look more at the evolution and practices of disciplinary scientific knowledge and technological commu­ nities. By the same token, attention to visual representation and instrumentation, wide­ spread in historical and cultural studies of science, is less common in the work of those with primary interests in the politics of S&amp;T. Ethnographic approaches have been used more often to study lab cultures and patients’ groups than, say, environmental controver­ sies or legal proceedings. More generally, constructivist theories have made greater headway in contemporary than in historical studies of science and technology, possibly because historical methods are poorly adapted to observations of science in the making. Comparable differences of theory, method, research styles, and topical emphasis, howev­ er, may be encountered within the most securely established and coherent disciplines.</p>
<p>13.2 Academic Institutionalization</p>
<p>Despite its creativity and originality, the branch of STS concerned with the nature and practices of contemporary S&amp;T was slow to gain a foothold in university structures. In part, this simply reflected the field’s growing pains: At the turn of the twenty-first centu­ ry, not many senior scholars of unquestioned eminence identified their careers unambigu­ ously with STS. In part, too, the field suffered from the balkanization that sets in when re­ sources are insufficient: Seeing little benefit from self-identification with STS, young scholars often reverted to better-recognized disciplinary affiliations, such as anthropolo­ gy, history or sociology, or to topical subfields within STS for which there was current market demand, such as bioethics, environmental studies, science policy, or even nan­ otechnology and society. In turn, such moves hampered the recognition of commonalities that cut across the field, with negative consequences for graduate education, which thrives best in a stable environment of accredited teaching centers and steady job oppor­ tunities.</p>
<p>Non-negligibly as well, STS in the 1990s earned a reputation for relativism that evoked scorn from working scientists, other social scientists, and some university administrators. Labeled the “science wars,” a subset of the culture wars then afflicting the universities, those exchanges called into question whether constructivist approaches fairly portray progress in science or advances in technology. Although difficult to document, worries about the field’s intellectual soundness and descriptive accuracy, coming at a time when</p>

<p>universities were becoming increasingly dependent on their links to science-based indus­ tries, may have inhibited the institutionalization of STS in the upper reaches of academia in several Western countries. The widely decried hostility toward science during the US presidency of George W. Bush, coupled with a growing perception that scientific progress and technological innovation are crucial for economic growth, may also have undermined institutional support for scholarship seen as questioning the authority of science.</p>
<p>Until the late 1980s, graduate studies of the nature and role of science and technology in US universities were mostly organized in one of the following ways: departments or pro­ grams in the history (and sometimes philosophy) of science and technology (HPST); pro­ grams (occasionally departments) in science, technology, and society (STS); and pro­ grams in science, technology, and public policy (STPP). These arrangements reflected a</p>
<p>number of tacit intellectual <img src="Aspose.Words.238a54b9-d97f-4d33-9f8a-9cceb23be694.005.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> boundaries. Historical and contemporary studies were</p>
<p>thought to belong in separate compartments; even at the University of Pennsylvania, where history and sociology of science nominally resided in the same department, the fo­ cus remained on social histories of science and medicine. The frequent pairing of history with philosophy of science reflected a union of interests in these fields around the con­ tent of scientific ideas. This alliance worked well for “internalist” historians, but less well for those venturing into social and cultural history. Another implicit boundary se­ questered studies of science, technology, and public policy within professional schools, as a supposedly “applied” field, away from the more “fundamental” humanities and social sciences (as at Harvard, Michigan, and Wisconsin). So conceived, STPP focused more on specific areas of scientific and technological practice than on broader ways of thinking about the nature of S&amp;T. A few programs and departments did not respect these divi­ sions, but they mostly existed at engineering colleges and technical universities, where they did not compete with traditional disciplines. Members of those programs, too, tend­ ed to define themselves as anthropologists, historians, sociologists, or political scientists rather than as representatives of an integrated field of STS.</p>
<p>Two external developments in the mid-1980s helped to partially remap these configura­ tions. First, the processes of global academic exchange brought about closer contact be­ tween European and North American scholarship, narrowing the gap between research traditions on the two sides of the Atlantic. Bridges were built between the more struc­ turalist and political approaches to studying S&amp;T in the United States and constructivist and philosophical scholarship in Europe. Second, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) opened a nationwide competition to support interdisciplinary graduate training in STS. This initiative led to the founding of three successive programs in the early 1990s, at the University of California–San Diego (UCSD), Cornell University, and the University of Minnesota. The Cornell grant spurred the establishment in 1991 of a Department of Science and Technology Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences. Merging the earlier HPST and STS programs, the new department comprised about a dozen faculty members offering both undergraduate and graduate training in STS. By the late 1990s, all three NSF-supported programs were producing doctorates and postdoctoral trainees who en­ tered the academic market and raised the profile of STS.</p>

<p>While such large-scale center awards ended after the first three, the NSF continued to support more modest, research-based graduate training in STS. A series of Small Grants for Training and Research (SGTRs) supported limited numbers of graduate students and postdocs to work on well-defined themes within the field. SGTR recipients in early years included Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Harvard (JFK School), Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Rensselaer Polytechnic. In addition, the NSF supported conferences and workshops de­ signed to promote curricular innovation and theoretical integration under particular the­ matic headings, such as diversity in science and engineering, or biology and the law. Tar­ geted funding for looking at technology’s social impacts and implications also became available under federally sponsored research programs such as the Human Genome Project and the National Nanotechnology Initiative; parallel initiatives emerged in Europe and (sometimes) East Asia, although with different funding models and implications for student training.</p>
<p>Unlike the earlier STS programs, the new STS maintained strength where it put down sol­ id institutional roots and made gradual inroads elsewhere. Thus, the NSF-funded pro­ grams at Cornell, Minnesota, and UCSD added faculty strength over time and, in some cases, branched into new areas of research, such as genomics, information technologies,</p>
<p>and <img src="Aspose.Words.238a54b9-d97f-4d33-9f8a-9cceb23be694.007.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> nanotechnology. The STS program at MIT, which already controlled its own</p>
<p>faculty lines, also grew during this period, partly by adopting a new doctoral program, al­ though the STS faculty remained organized along mostly disciplinary lines with greatest strengths in history and anthropology. STS departments or programs at some prominent technical universities (e.g., Georgia Tech, Rensselaer Polytechnic, Virginia Polytechnic, University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science) made additional profes­ sorial appointments. In the midwest, the University of Michigan appointed STS scholars in several departments and created an STS undergraduate certificate program. The Uni­ versity of Wisconsin, home to well-established history of science and history of medicine departments, appointed a cluster of STS scholars and established a graduate certificate program in STS. Similar developments occurred in the University of California system, es­ pecially at Berkeley, Davis, and Santa Cruz, during the early years of the twenty-first cen­ tury. Rapid expansions in research and graduate training at Arizona State University in­ cluded a build-up of STS scholars and the establishment in 2008 of a doctoral program in the human and social dimensions of science and technology.</p>
<p>Science and technology studies was recognized as a field of graduate training in a num­ ber of northern European countries (Netherlands, Scandinavia, Switzerland, United King­ dom) during the 1970s. Subsequently, from the turn of the century, the European Union began supporting a widening network of universities offering a standardized master’s lev­ el curriculum in STS, administered through the University of Maastricht in the Nether­ lands in collaboration with the European Interuniversity Association on Society, Science and Technology. In the same period, the French government added a required component of history and philosophy of science to graduate training in S&amp;T, while other state-funded initiatives looked to strengthen research and training in STS more broadly. Initiatives in Germany included most importantly the STS graduate programs at the University of Bielefeld, a preeminent center for interdisciplinary studies. When STS lost strength at</p>

<p>Bielefeld through faculty attrition, research continued in smaller clusters funded by Germany’s “excellence initiative,” as well as programs initiated by institutions such as the Technical University of Munich. Several southern (and eventually eastern) European countries also built strength in STS during the 1990s, usually through professional soci­ eties and European research collaborations. Japan formed an STS network of its own in 1990, and by the late 1990s actively participated with China, South Korea, and Taiwan in an East Asian STS network served by its own specialist journal and professional meet­ ings. From the mid-1990s the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences undertook a major ef­ fort to publish STS work, often with an emphasis on the impacts and social control of technology.</p>
<p>13.3 Research Frontiers</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary research is often driven by questions that demand input from more than one area of study. Policy research is a prime example: To know how best to control green­ house emissions from automobiles, one needs to know something about the design of cars, the economics of innovation, the dynamics of the automobile market, the impact of incentives on consumer behavior, and the laws regulating air pollution at state and feder­ al levels. No single field or person possesses all the necessary knowledge; collaboration</p>
<p>among <img src="Aspose.Words.238a54b9-d97f-4d33-9f8a-9cceb23be694.009.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> disciplinary frameworks and their distinctive knowledge systems—on the</p>
<p>model of interstate highway construction—is therefore crucial. Significant developments in STS, however, were driven by questions of a different kind: those that one field sought to appropriate from others, and those that no field had thought to investigate before. In each case, the impetus was to view scientific and technological production as social do­ mains deserving fine-grained study, and thus to bring the full-blown apparatus of social analysis, including interpretive methods, to elucidating those dynamics. The results, in cartographic terms, were consistent with the model of charting the unknown seas to dis­ cover new islands of insight and learning.</p>
<p>Published in 2007, the third edition of <em>The Handbook of Science and Technology Studies</em> ran to 1,080 pages, comprising 38 chapters organized under 5 topical headings <a href='#page16'>(Hackett</a> <a href='#page16'>et al. 2007; </a>for comparison, see also the second handbook edited by <a href='#page16'>Jasanoff et al. 1995)</a>. The 2008 joint meeting of the European and American societies for STS showcased around a thousand presented papers; the 2010 Society for Social Studies of Science meeting, held in Tokyo, featured more than 200 sessions. Clearly, any attempt to charac­ terize the research frontiers represented by all this activity risks simplification to the point of caricature. Nevertheless, some broad strokes may convey the unique nature of STS’s interdisciplinarity.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest foundations for STS were laid, as we have seen, by sociologists and anthropologists who provided minute but eye-opening accounts of the scientific practices that lead to the creation of facts. The resulting genre of laboratory studies remains a sta­ ple of STS, but its focus has widened to include many more dimensions of practice than the moments of significant discovery or revolutionary change that concerned early histo­</p>

<p>rians of S&amp;T. The conception of science itself expanded to accommodate wider domains of systematic knowledge production and technological uptake, from automobile engineering and weapons development to environmental and financial modeling, the creation of mar­ kets and fiscal instruments, and varied indicator systems, such as the metrics used to measure scientific productivity. A second direction was to investigate not just the leading figures associated with breakthroughs and prizes but also the invisible technicians, in­ strument-makers, nurses, counselors, forensic practitioners, and even patent writers without whose involvement scientific knowledge could not be produced or disseminated beyond the lab or the clinic. A third extension was to pay closer attention to the myriad nonhuman elements that play a part in the discovery process, from mice to microscopes to microarrays.</p>
<p>A more subtle shift occurred as researchers considered not only the production of new knowledge but also its circulation in society. A seminal history of experimental practices in Restoration England by <a href='#page16'>Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer (1985) </a>called attention to the importance of credibility and witnessing in the spread of experimental science— themes that these and other authors developed in later work. While many STS re­ searchers addressed reception and uptake within expert communities, subsequent work showed that broader social analysis was needed to understand the authority of science in the modern world. Thus, studies of the public understanding of science <a href='#page17'>(Wynne 1995) </a>and science used in public policy (Jasanoff <a href='#page16'>1990, 2005) </a>followed science out of its contexts of production into contexts of interpretation and use, where science acquired substantial power to shape the directions of human advancement and well-being.</p>
<p>Questions of reception—whether inside or outside the circles of scientific practice—are intimately linked to an abiding STS concern with the relationship between science, pow­ er, and politics, especially in democratic societies. Although research in this area has shifted in focus and methodology over more than 40 years, it too provides powerful justifi­</p>
<p>cation for <img src="Aspose.Words.238a54b9-d97f-4d33-9f8a-9cceb23be694.008.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> the acknowledgment of STS as a distinct academic field. Salient in­</p>
<p>sights include the following: Controversies are productive social moments, offering win­ dows on the ambiguity of scientific observations and the possible existence of alternative interpretations; technological systems are agents of governance because, like laws and social norms, they both enable and constrain behavior; S&amp;T policies, in both the public and private sector, build on tacit and inarticulate imaginations of what the public wants or needs; public participation and engagement are essential for ensuring that the imagi­ nations of states and industries are held to critical scrutiny and democratic oversight. Some of these findings are now so taken for granted that they underwrite operational rules of citizen participation in most technologically advanced societies; others are in­ choate and remain to be translated into political and administrative action. Science and technology studies scholars have become increasingly involved not only in generating knowledge about the relations between science and politics but also in the translation work needed to convert knowledge to action <a href='#page16'>(Fisher 2011)</a>.<a href='#page17'>6</a></p>

<p>13.4 Outlook: Barriers and Opportunities</p>
<p>Some 50 years into the life of a new field, and 15 years into a new century, STS remains weakly institutionalized in the upper reaches of global academia. Despite growing atten­ tion to the field’s intellectual contributions, there are few full-fledged STS departments in the United States, even fewer in Europe, and barely any in Asia or Latin America. Depart­ ments, moreover, tend to cluster in engineering schools and, with few exceptions, have not taken hold in high-prestige research universities, where STS has to compete with long-established social sciences and humanities. Large hurdles remain. These are built in­ to the political economy of the disciplines in contemporary higher education, as well as into STS’s own contradictory self-understandings. Briefly, there are three challenges of disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity that STS will have to overcome before it can take its place as a necessary, indeed indispensable, component of higher education: establishing credible relations with its objects of study (S&amp;T); defining its relations to other disci­ plines; and asserting a stronger sense of its own boundaries and mission. The good news is that STS has the resources to meet all three; the bad news is that STS scholars have not yet chosen as a community systematically to tackle any.</p>
<p>First, STS faces the not inconsiderable difficulties of “studying up”: it presents a classic case of a less established, less accredited field commenting on ones that are far more se­ curely established, generously endowed, and seen as conferring more obvious public ben­ efits. It is well known that such power differentials affect the content and credibility of academic analysis. With respect to science and technology, in particular, practitioners are often skeptical that anyone not trained in a technical field could have legitimate things to say about that field’s workings. Indeed, many of the earliest entrants into STS held post­ graduate degrees in science or engineering before becoming professional observers of</p>
<p>those fields. Physicists <img src="Aspose.Words.238a54b9-d97f-4d33-9f8a-9cceb23be694.010.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> became historians of physics, while biologists took up the</p>
<p>historical or sociological study of biology, and engineers became major contributors to the history of technology. Yet, the requirement that one must be formally qualified in a field in order to speak authoritatively about it not only restricts access but also narrows the analyst’s capacity to ask probing questions; an insider perspective develops that neither accommodates nor grasps the benefits of the outsider’s questioning gaze. A consequence of this attitude in early STS work was to pay disproportionate attention to the production of scientific knowledge in relation to understanding how scientific claims and practices circulate through and are incorporated into society. Only with the emergence of STS as a field of its own has this imbalance between production and reception gradually been righted.</p>
<p>Second, STS has to confront charges of redundancy. Science and technology studies claims special status as “the” field that observes and interprets the work of S&amp;T, but this privileged position is by no means universally accepted. Indeed, the traditional social sci­ ences and humanities at many universities are reluctant to concede any territory to an autonomous STS. Disciplinary scholars insist more or less openly that the map of existing disciplines is good enough to support any of the highways needed for traffic in STS. Thus, it is difficult to persuade a sociologist that STS is not synonymous with the sociology of</p>

<p>science, or an anthropologist that anything more than ethnography is needed to study the cultures of science or technology. Accordingly, strict disciplinarians argue that there is lit­ tle value to STS as sovereign academic currency. It unlocks no doors to new research questions or methods, let alone to successful professional careers. Would-be STS gradu­ ate students are often told that they would be better off with a degree in a recognized dis­ cipline, with a sideline in studying science or technology. These are, to some degree, self-serving assessments. Few of the disciplines named in the <em>IESBS</em> have recognized the study of science and technology as legitimate specialties within their own intellectual configurations. More usual is the reaction of a political scientist at a major research uni­ versity who once told me, “My department would never hire someone in the politics of science.” Regrettably, blocking appointments and degree programs in STS effectively dries up the pipeline of human resources dedicated to comprehensive studies of S&amp;T. Uni­ versity administrators for their part can rarely be counted on to create new conditions of possibility. Faced with interdisciplinary boundary struggles and resource constraints, they are more likely to draw back from the hard work of adjudicating among competing claims, to the disadvantage of any new island in the academic high seas.</p>
<p>Third, many scholars who see themselves as members of the STS community are hesitant to support disciplining in either sense of that term: importing order and coherence into the delightfully unruly territory they came to know as STS in the 1970s; or constituting STS as what some dismissively called a “high-church,” an elitist and exclusionary acade­ mic enclave that inhibits free thinking and creativity (see <a href='#page16'>Fuller 1993)</a>. External funding initiatives, whether from governments or private donors and foundations, could overcome some of these hesitations, to the point of grounding new programs and reviving old ones (e.g., at Cornell, UCSD, and Wisconsin in the United States). Forging new transdiscipli­ nary identities, however, demands an intensity of effort and engagement that seems un­ necessary to academics whose own histories are discipline-based. Even the most secure STS programs in the United States and elsewhere have endured identity crises at some point in their development; at such times, moreover, new fields are substantially more likely than old ones to succumb to administrative pressures for efficiency and cost-cut­ ting.</p>
<p><img src="Aspose.Words.238a54b9-d97f-4d33-9f8a-9cceb23be694.007.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> Fields demand organization for their survival and continuity, both to demarcate</p>
<p>them from neighboring territories and to set up internal markers by which to measure such academically essential attributes as originality, quality, progress, and contributions to fundamental knowledge. Yet in a field’s emergent, formative phase, attempts to devel­ op a curriculum, create a canon, evaluate students and faculty for professional advance­ ment, or even represent the field in an encyclopedia or handbook all arouse high tension and anxiety. Who will be brought in and celebrated; who will be left out? Many therefore prefer the quieter option, which is to retain STS as a loosely constructed society to which anyone with a passing interest can gain easy entry. This broad-church approach satisfies liberal academics’ deep-seated desire for intellectual democracy, but it also gets in the way of critical stock-taking, meaningful theorizing, and methodological innovation—in short, of <em>disciplining</em>. In this respect, STS operates as its own most effective critic. It rati­</p>

<p>fies a status quo that militates against the field’s maturation as a self-defining, self-gov­ erning area of inquiry.</p>
<p>13.5 Conclusion</p>
<p>The problem of interdisciplinarity is often posed as one of harmonization, or bringing dis­ parate perspectives into alignment so that different discourses can speak productively with one another. Much as independent nation-states have trouble subordinating their di­ vergent interests and political cultures to agreements on common problems, so the tradi­ tional disciplines encounter frictions in their efforts to focus on socially salient phenome­ na—from climate change to the roiling of global financial markets—that seem to demand investigation from multiple perspectives. How should number crunchers speak to qualita­ tive analysts, or critical theorists engage with advocates of game theory and rational choice? How should inductive, evidence-based, and practice-oriented scholarship find common ground with principled approaches that draw authority from historical texts and frameworks that have little bearing on the issues of the present? Is integration possible and desirable, as in behavioral science or area studies (see <a href='https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198733522.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198733522-e-3#'>Klein</a>, this volume), or are ex­ change and bridge-building the only realistic alternatives? And who decides when and by what criteria participants in an interdisciplinary venture have made sufficient contribu­ tions to the purposes of the academy to merit their own charter of independence?</p>
<p>Science and technology studies has encountered all of these problems, and to some ex­ tent coped with them, but in a context that makes the field’s challenges larger and more consequential than those of interdisciplinarity more generally. For what is at stake in the success of STS is the underlying self-understanding of the disciplines themselves as co­ herent and unified entities. By contesting such dominant understandings, as a field with epistemology as its primary focus <em>must</em> do, STS enters into troubled and uncertain territo­ ry. In the terms sketched here, the future of STS depends on redrawing the map of the disciplines to demonstrate that they are all islands of happenstance, with unmapped wa­ ters between; STS then can claim a space for itself as another fertile territory in these wide waters, offering resources for understanding some of humanity’s most impressive accomplishments, but without threatening anything achieved, or yet to be achieved, in other quarters of the disciplinary archipelago. What is needed to make this case, first and</p>
<p>foremost, is an abiding conviction <img src="Aspose.Words.238a54b9-d97f-4d33-9f8a-9cceb23be694.011.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> on the part of STS-islanders that they have</p>
<p>shared crafts and practices, and valuable goods to offer, in the ongoing enterprises of pedagogy and scholarship. There are major obstacles to achieving such agreement, both internal and external to the field. Equally, however, there are growing numbers of ambas­ sadors abroad who confidently wear the badge of STS as their primary academic creden­ tial. The future of the field will depend on their intellectual ambition, rhetorical skills, and diplomatic acumen.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<p>(<a href='#page1'>1</a>) I had already coedited the second edition of the field’s own handbook (<a href='https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198733522.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198733522-e-15#oxfordhb-9780198733522-e-15-bibItem-332'>Jasanoff et al.</a> <a href='https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198733522.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198733522-e-15#oxfordhb-9780198733522-e-15-bibItem-332'>1995)</a>, but inclusion in the <em>IESBS</em> meant more explicitly staking out a claim for STS in re­ lation to other disciplines.</p>
<p>(<a href='#page2'>2</a>) The story told in this chapter is unavoidably US- and Euro-centric, given the author’s experiences and knowledge limitations. However, STS is an increasingly international field, whose past, present, and future rest on global networks of scholarship and ex­ change. One way to strengthen the account offered here would be to trace parallel ge­ nealogies of the emergence of STS from other national and regional vantage points, par­ ticularly in emerging industrial societies. That is an impossible undertaking in a chapter of this scope. Yet, the coming together of those histories, and the resulting strands of the­ orizing and research, in the global academic marketplace will undoubtedly contribute to STS’s future strength and liveliness.</p>
<p>(<a href='#page2'>3</a>) Note that the two alternatives captured by my cartographic metaphor correspond roughly to the categories of multidisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity presented in Klein’s taxonomy in this volume. The taxonomic approach, however, does not problematize the taken-for-grantedness of disciplinary boundaries, nor emphasize their contingency or question their claims to coherence as I implicitly do in this chapter.</p>
<p>(<a href='#page3'>4</a>) SSK contrasted, in particular, with then dominant trends in US sociology of science, which concentrated more on the social organization and roles of scientists than on their specific knowledge-producing practices. American sociology of science was led by a num­ ber of distinguished practitioners, such as Robert K. Merton of Columbia, but their work increasingly diverged in aims and methods from the more epistemologically, metaphysi­ cally, and semiotically inclined European schools.</p>
<p>(<a href='#page7'>5</a>) Institutional changes supporting this expansion of the STS agenda include the estab­ lishment of the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies in 2001, the launch of the international journal <em>East Asian Science, Technology and Society</em> in 2007, and the formation of the STS-Africa Network in 2011.</p>
<p>(<a href='#page12'>6</a>) Warranting mention in this connection is the entire special issue of <em>Science and Engi­</em> <em>neering Ethics</em>, Vol. 17, No. 4 (2011), “Science and Technology in the Making: Observa­* tion and Engagement,” edited by Stephanie Bird and Erik Fisher.</p>
