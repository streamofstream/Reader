<p>short chronological sample within a restricted geographical

affected</p>
<p>the knowledge of things and their order, the . . . only one, that
which began</p>

made it</p>
<p>possible for the figure of man to appear. And that appearance . . .
was the</p>
<p>effect of a change in the fundamental arrangements of knowledge. . . .
If</p>

<p>the argument proposes that the struggle of our new millennium willbe
one between the ongoing imperative of securing the well-being of
ourpresent ethnoclass (i.e., Western bourgeois) conception of the
human, Man,which overrepresents itself as if it were the human itself,
and that of secur-ing the well-being, and therefore the full cognitive
and behavioral autonomyof the human species itself/ourselves. Because
of this overrepresentation,which is defined in the first part of the
title as the Coloniality of Being/Power/Truth/Freedom, any attempt to
unsettle the coloniality of power willcall for the unsettling of this
overrepresentation as the second and nowpurely secular form of what
Aníbal Quijano identifies as the &quot;Racism/Ethnicism complex,&quot; on whose
basis the world of modernity was broughtinto existence from the
fifteenth/sixteenth centuries onwards (Quijano 1999,2000),2 and of
what Walter Mignolo identifies as the foundational
&quot;colonialdifference&quot; on which the world of modernity was to institute
itself (Mignolo1999, 2000).3</p>
<p>The correlated hypothesis here is that all our present struggles

struggles over theenvironment, global warming, severe climate change,
the sharply unequaldistribution of the earth resources (20 percent of

<p>earth&#39;s peoples living relatively affluent lives while four billion
still live on theedge of hunger and immiseration, to the dynamic of
overconsumption onthe part of the rich techno-industrial North
paralleled by that of overpopu-lation on the part of the dispossessed
poor, still partly agrarian worlds of theSouth4)---these are all
differing facets of the central ethnoclass Man vs.Human struggle.
Central to this struggle also is the usually excluded andinvisibilized
situation of the category identified by Zygmunt Bauman as the&quot;New Poor&quot;
(Bauman 1987). That is, as a category defined at the global levelby
refugee/economic migrants stranded outside the gates of the rich
coun-tries, as the postcolonial variant of Fanon&#39;s category of les
damnés (Fanon1963)---with this category in the United States coming to
comprise the crim-inalized majority Black and dark-skinned Latino
inner-city males now madeto man the rapidly expanding prison-industrial
complex, together with theirfemale peers---the kicked-about Welfare
Moms---with both being part of theever-expanding global, transracial
category of the homeless/the jobless, thesemi-jobless, the criminalized
drug-offending prison population. So that ifwe see this category of the
damnés that is internal to (and interned within)the prison system of the
United States as the analog form of a global archi-pelago, constituted
by the Third- and Fourth-World peoples of the so-called&quot;underdeveloped&quot;
areas of the world---most totally of all by the peoples ofthe continent
of Africa (now stricken with AIDS, drought, and ongoing civilwars, and
whose bottommost place as the most impoverished of all theearth&#39;s
continents is directly paralleled by the situation of its Black
Diasporapeoples, with Haiti being produced and reproduced as the most
impover-ished nation of the Americas)---a systemic pattern emerges. This
pattern islinked to the fact that while in the post-sixties United
States, as HerbertGans noted recently, the Black population group, of
all the multiple groupscomprising the post-sixties social hierarchy, has
once again come to beplaced at the bottommost place of that hierarchy
(Gans, 1999), with allincoming new nonwhite/non-Black groups, as Gans&#39;s
fellow sociologistAndrew Hacker (1992) earlier pointed out, coming to
claim &quot;normal&quot; NorthAmerican identity by the putting of visible distance
between themselves andthe Black population group (in effect, claiming
&quot;normal&quot; human status bydistancing themselves from the group that is
still made to occupy the nadir,</p>

<blockquote><p>&quot;nigger&quot; rung of being human within the terms of our present
ethnoclassMan&#39;s overrepresentation of its &quot;descriptive statement&quot;
[Bateson 1969] as ifit were that of the human itself), then the
struggle of our times, one that hashitherto had no name, is the
struggle against this overrepresentation. As astruggle whose first
phase, the Argument proposes, was first put in place (ifonly for a
brief hiatus before being coopted, reterritorialized [Godzich
1986])by the multiple anticolonial social-protest movements and
intellectual chal-lenges of the period to which we give the name, &quot;The
Sixties.&quot;\
The further proposal here is that, although the brief hiatus during
whichthe sixties&#39; large-scale challenge based on multiple issues,
multiple local ter-rains of struggles (local struggles against, to use
Mignolo&#39;s felicitous phrase,a &quot;global design&quot; [Mignolo 2000])
erupted was soon to be erased, several ofthe issues raised then would
continue to be articulated, some in sanitizedforms (those pertaining
to the category defined by Bauman as &quot;the seduced&quot;),others in more
harshly intensified forms (those pertaining to Bauman&#39;s cate-gory of
the &quot;repressed&quot; [Bauman 1987]). Both forms of &quot;sanitization&quot;
would,however, function in the same manner as the lawlike effects of
the post-six-ties&#39; vigorous discursive and institutional
re-elaboration of the central over-representation, which enables the
interests, reality, and well-being of theempirical human world to
continue to be imperatively subordinated to thoseof the now globally
hegemonic ethnoclass world of &quot;Man.&quot; This, in the sameway as in an
earlier epoch and before what Howard Winant identifies as the&quot;immense
historical rupture&quot; of the &quot;Big Bang&quot; processes that were to lead toa
contemporary modernity defined by the &quot;rise of the West&quot; and the
&quot;subju-gation of the rest of us&quot; (Winant 1994)---before, therefore,
the secularizingintellectual revolution of Renaissance humanism,
followed by the decentral-izing religious heresy of the Protestant
Reformation and the rise of the mod-ern state---the then world of
laymen and laywomen, including the institutionof the political state,
as well as those of commerce and of economic produc-tion, had remained
subordinated to that of the post-Gregorian ReformChurch of
Latin-Christian Europe (Le Goff 1983), and therefore to the &quot;rulesof
the social order&quot; and the theories &quot;which gave them sanction&quot; (See
Konradand Szelenyi guide-quote), as these rules were articulated by
its theologiansand implemented by its celibate clergy (See Le Goff

<p>The Janus face of the emergence of Mignolo&#39;s proposed
&quot;modernity/colo-niality&quot; complementarity is sited here. As also is the
answer to the why of thefact that, as Aníbal Quijano insists in his Qué
tal Raza! (2000), the &quot;idea ofrace&quot; would come to be &quot;the most efficient
instrument of social dominationinvented in the last 500 years.&quot; In order
for the world of the laity, includingthat of the then ascendant modern
European state, to escape their subordi-nation to the world of the
Church, it had been enabled to do so only on thebasis of what Michel
Foucault identifies as the &quot;invention of Man&quot;: that is, bythe
Renaissance humanists&#39; epochal redescription of the human outside
theterms of the then theocentric, &quot;sinful by nature&quot; conception/
&quot;descriptivestatement&quot; of the human, on whose basis the hegemony of the
Church/clergyover the lay world of Latin-Christian Europe had been
supernaturally legiti-mated (Chorover 1979). While, if this
redescription was effected by the layworld&#39;s invention of Man as the
political subject of the state, in the tran-sumed and reoccupied place
of its earlier matrix identity Christian, the per-formative enactment of
this new &quot;descriptive statement&quot; and its master codeof symbolic life and
death, as the first secular or &quot;degodded&quot; (if, at the time,still only
partly so) mode of being human in the history of the species, was tobe
effected only on the basis of what Quijano identifies as the
&quot;coloniality ofpower,&quot; Mignolo as the &quot;colonial difference,&quot; and Winant
as a huge projectdemarcating human differences thinkable as a &quot;racial
longue durée.&quot; One ofthe major empirical effects of which would be &quot;the
rise of Europe&quot; and itsconstruction of the &quot;world civilization&quot; on the
one hand, and, on the other,African enslavement, Latin American
conquest, and Asian subjugation.</p>

<blockquote><p>of our modes of being human, by means of its/their re-invention of the
theo-centric &quot;descriptive statement&quot; Christian as that of Man in two
forms. Thefirst was from the Renaissance to the eighteenth century;
the second fromthen on until today, thereby making possible both the
conceptualizability ofnatural causality, and of nature as an
autonomously functioning force in itsown right governed by its own
laws (i.e., <em>cursus solitus naturae</em>) (Hubner1983; Blumenberg 1983;
Hallyn 1990), with this, in turn, making possible thecognitively
emancipatory rise and gradual development of the physical sci-ences
(in the wake of the invention of Man1), and then of the biological
sci-ences (in the wake of the nineteenth century invention of Man2).
These wereto be processes made possible only on the basis of the
dynamics of a colo-nizer/colonized relation that the West was to
discursively constitute andempirically institutionalize on the islands
of the Caribbean and, later, on themainlands of the Americas.\
This seeing that if, as Quijano rightly insists, race---unlike gender
(whichhas a biogenetically determined anatomical differential
correlate onto whicheach culture&#39;s system of gendered oppositions can
be anchored)---is a purelyinvented construct that has no such
correlate (Quijano 2000), it was thisconstruct that would enable the
now globally expanding West to replace theearlier mortal/immortal,
natural/supernatural, human/the ancestors, thegods/God distinction as
the one on whose basis all human groups had mil-lennially &quot;grounded&quot;
their descriptive statement/prescriptive statements ofwhat it is to be
human, and to reground its secularizing own on a newly pro-jected
human/subhuman distinction instead. That is, on Quijano&#39;s
&quot;Racism/Ethnicism&quot; complex, Winant&#39;s &quot;race concept,&quot; Mignolo&#39;s
&quot;colonial difference,&quot;redefined in the terms of the Spanish state&#39;s
theoretical construct of a &quot;by-nature difference&quot; between Spaniards
and the indigenous peoples of theAmericas (Padgen 1982): a difference
defined in Ginés de Sepúlveda&#39;s six-teenth-century terms as almost a
difference between &quot;monkeys and men,&quot;homunculi and true humans. &quot;Race&quot;
was therefore to be, in effect, the non-supernatural but no less
extrahuman ground (in the reoccupied place of thetraditional
ancestors/gods, God, ground) of the answer that the secularizingWest
would now give to the Heideggerian question as to the who, and thewhat
we are.</p>

<p>In his 1999 Coloniality Working Group conference presentation,
WalterMignolo perceptively identified one of the consequences of the
&quot;Big Bang&quot;initiation of the &quot;colonial difference&quot; as that of the fact
that, &quot;in the imagi-nary of the modern/colonial world system sustainable
knowledge . . . disre-garded Amerindian ways of knowing and knowledge
production that werereduced to curious practices of strange people and,
in another domain weredemonized.&quot; However, the anthropologist Jacob
Pandian (1985) enables us tosee that this epistemological &quot;disregard&quot;
was itself part of an even more cen-tral imperative---that of the
sustainability of the new mode of being human,of its epochal
redescription as, primarily, that of the political subject of thestate
Man in the transumed and reoccupied place of Latin-ChristianEurope&#39;s
founding matrix description, Christian, which had defined thehuman as
primarily the religious subject of the Church. While, if this
newdescriptive statement (one that was to gradually privatize as well as
harnessthe matrix Christian identity to the realizing of the modern
state&#39;s own sec-ular goals of imperial territorial expansion) was also
to be effected on thebasis of a parallel series of discursive and
institutional inventions, there wasone that was to be as novel as it was
to be central. This, as Pandian docu-ments, was to be that of the West&#39;s
transformation of the indigenous peo-ples of the Americas/the Caribbean
(culturally classified as Indians,indios/indias), together with the
population group of the enslaved peoplesof Africa, transported across
the Atlantic (classified as Negroes,negros/negras) into the physical
referents of its reinvention of medievalEurope&#39;s Untrue Christian Other
to its normative True Christian Self, as thatof the Human Other to its
new &quot;descriptive statement&quot; of the ostensibly onlynormal human, Man.\
In his seminal book, <em>Anthropology and the Western Tradition: Towardsan
Authentic Anthropology</em> (1985), Jacob Pandian enables us to see
thatwithin the terms of the Judeo-Christian religious creed (within the
terms,therefore, of its variant of the &quot;formulation of a general order
of existence,&quot;correlated &quot;postulate of a significant ill,&quot; and therefore
proposed behavior-motivating &quot;cure&quot; or &quot;plan of salvation&quot; that is
defining of all religions[Girardot 1988]), the physical referents of
the conception of the Untrue Otherto the True Christian Self had been
the categories of peoples defined in reli-</p>

pagan-idolaters (with Jews serving as the boundary-transgressive &quot;name
of what isevil&quot; figures, stigmatized as Christ-killing deicides). In
the wake of the West&#39;sreinvention of its True Christian Self in the
transumed terms of the RationalSelf of Man1, however, it was to be the
peoples of the militarily expropriatedNew World territories (i.e.,
Indians), as well as the enslaved peoples of BlackAfrica (i.e.,
Negroes), that were made to reoccupy the matrix slot ofOtherness---to
be made into the physical referent of the idea of the
irra-tional/subrational Human Other, to this first degodded (if still
hybridly reli-gio-secular) &quot;descriptive statement&quot; of the human in
history, as thedescriptive statement that would be foundational to
modernity.\
So that rather than &quot;sustainable knowledge&quot; merely disregarding
the&quot;other ways of knowing&quot; of the Amerindian peoples, as Mignolo
contends,Pandian proposes instead that it was to be the discourses of
this knowledge,including centrally those of anthropology, that would
function to constructall the non-Europeans that encountered (including
those whose lands itssettlers expropriated and those whom they
enslaved or enserfed) as thephysical referent of, in the first phase,
its irrational or subrational HumanOther to its new &quot;descriptive
statement&quot; of Man as a political subject. Whilethe &quot;Indians&quot; were
portrayed as the very acme of the savage, irrational Other,the
&quot;Negroes&quot; were assimilated to the former&#39;s category, represented as
itsmost extreme form and as the ostensible missing link between
rationalhumans and irrational animals. However, in the wake of the
West&#39;s secondwave of imperial expansion, pari passu with its
reinvention of in Man nowpurely biologized terms, it was to be the
peoples of Black African descentwho would be constructed as the
ultimate referent of the &quot;racially inferior&quot;Human Other, with the
range of other colonized dark-skinned peoples, allclassified as
&quot;natives,&quot; now being assimilated to its category---all of these asthe
ostensible embodiment of the non-evolved backward Others---if to
vary-ing degrees and, as such, the negation of the generic &quot;normal
humanness,&quot;ostensibly expressed by and embodied in the peoples of the
West.Nevertheless, if the range of Native Others were now to be

<p>Other, the most salient of all these was to be that of the mythology of
theBlack Other of sub-Saharan Africans (and their Diaspora descendants).
It isthis population group who would come to be made, several centuries
on,into an indispensable function of the enacting of our present
Darwinian&quot;dysselected by Evolution until proven otherwise&quot; descriptive
statement ofthe human on the biocentric model of a natural organism.
With this popu-lation group&#39;s systemic stigmatization, social
inferiorization, and dynami-cally produced material deprivation thereby
serving both to &quot;verify&quot; theoverrepresentation of Man as if it were the
human, and to legitimate thesubordination of the world and well-being of
the latter to those of the for-mer. All of this was done in a lawlike
manner through the systemic stigma-tization of the Earth in terms of its
being made of a &quot;vile and base matter,&quot;a matter ontologically different
from that which attested to the perfection ofthe heavens, and thereby
(as such) divinely condemned to be fixed andunmoving at the center of
the universe as its dregs because the abode of apost-Adamic &quot;fallen&quot;
mankind had been an indispensable function of the&quot;verifying&quot; of medieval
Latin-Christian Europe&#39;s then theocentric descrip-tive statement of
human as &quot;sinful by nature.&quot; In this way, the descriptivestatement on
which the hegemony of the world of the Church over the layworld was
legitimated (Chorover 1979).\
Gregory Bateson and Frantz Fanon, thinking and writing during
theupheaval of the anticolonial/social-protest movements of the sixties,
wereboth to put forward new conceptions of the human outside the terms
of ourpresent ethnoclass conception that define it on the model of a
natural organ-ism, as these terms are elaborated by the disciplinary
paradigms and overallorganization of knowledge of our present episteme
(Foucault 1973). In anessay entitled &quot;Conscious Purpose vs. Nature,&quot;
published in 1969, Batesonproposed that in the same way as the
&quot;physiology&quot; and &quot;neurology&quot; of thehuman individual function in order to
conserve the body and all the body&#39;sphysical characteristics---thereby
serving as an overall system that con-serves descriptive statements
about the human as far as his/her body is con-cerned---so a correlated
process can be seen to be at work at the level of thepsyche or the soul.
To put it another way, not only is the descriptive state-ment of the
psyche/soul determinant of the kind of higher-level learning</p>

<blockquote><p>that must take place, seeing that the indispensable function of each
suchsystem of learning must be, imperatively, to conserve that
descriptive state-ment, but it is also determinant of the overall
range of acquired know-howthat is produced by the interactions of the
wider society in which each indi-vidual finds itself---and as a
society whose overall descriptive statement willnecessarily be of the
same general order as that of the individual, at the levelof the
psyche/soul. All such learning, whether at the microlevel of the
indi-vidual or at the macrolevel of the society, must therefore
function within theterms of what Foucault has identified as a specific
&quot;regime&quot; and/or &quot;politicsof truth&quot; (Foucault 1980, 1981).\
Fanon had then gone on to analyze the systemically negative
represen-tation of the Negro and of his African past that defined the
curriculum ofthe French colonial school system of the Caribbean island
of Martinique inwhich he had grown up (one in which, as he also notes,
no Black counter-voice had been allowed to exist), in order to reveal
why, as a result of thestructures of Bateson&#39;s system of learning
designed to preserve the statusquo, the Antillean Negro had indeed
been socialized to be normally anti-Negro. Nor, the Argument proposes,
was there anything arbitrary about thisdeliberate blocking out or
disregard of a &quot;Black&quot; voice, of a positive Blackself-conception.
Rather this &quot;blocking out&quot; of a Black counter-voice was, andis itself
defining of the way in which being human, in the terms of our pres-ent
ethnoclass mode of sociogeny, dictates that Self, Other, and World
shouldbe represented and known; a lay counter-voice could no more have
normallyexisted within the terms of the mode of sociogeny of medieval
Latin-Christian Europe. In consequence, because it is this premise
that underliesthe interlinked nature of what I have defined (on the
basis of Quijano&#39;sfounding concept of the coloniality of power) as the
Coloniality of Being/Power/Truth/Freedom, with the logical inference
that one cannot &quot;unsettle&quot;the &quot;coloniality of power&quot; without a
redescription of the human outside theterms of our present descriptive
statement of the human, Man, and its over-representation (outside the
terms of the &quot;natural organism&quot; answer that wegive to the question of
the who and the what we are), the Argument will firstlink this premise
to a fundamental thesis developed by Nicholas Humphreyin his book <em>A
History of the Mind: Evolution and the Birth of Consciousness</em>,</p>

disputebetween Bartolomé de Las Casas, the missionary priest, on the one
hand,and the humanist royal historian and apologist for the Spanish
settlers ofthen Santo Domingo, Ginés de Sepúlveda, on the other---as a
dispute that itwill define as one between two descriptive statements of
the human: one forwhich the expansion of the Spanish state was envisaged
as a function of theChristian evangelizing mission, the Other for which
the latter mission wasseen as a function of the imperial expansion of
the state; a dispute, then,between the theocentric conception of the
human, Christian, and the newhumanist and ratiocentric conception of the
human, Man2 (i.e., as homopoliticus, or the political subject of the
state).\
Here, the Argument, basing itself on Fanon&#39;s and Bateson&#39;s
redefinitionof the human, proposes that the adaptive truth-for terms in
which eachpurely organic species must know the world is no less true in
our humancase. That therefore, our varying ontogeny/sociogeny modes of
beinghuman, as inscribed in the terms of each culture&#39;s descriptive
statement, willnecessarily give rise to their varying respective
modalities of adaptive truths-for, or epistemes, up to and including our
contemporary own. Further, thatgiven the biocentric descriptive
statement that is instituting of our presentmode of sociogeny, the way
we at present normatively know Self, Other, andsocial World is no less
adaptively true as the condition of the continued pro-duction and
reproduction of such a genre of being human and of its orderas, before
the revolution initiated by the Renaissance humanists, and giventhe then
theocentric descriptive statement that had been instituting of themode
of sociogeny of medieval Latin-Christian Europe, its subjects had
nor-matively known Self, Other, as well as their social, physical, and
organicworlds, in the adaptively true terms needed for the production
and repro-duction not only of their then supernaturally legitimated
genre of beinghuman, but as well for that of the hierarchical social
structures in whoseintersubjective field that genre of the human could
have alone realized itself. And it is with the production and
reproduction of the latter (i.e., thesocial world) that a crucial
difference needs to be identified in our humancase. This was the
difference identified by C. P. Snow when he described ourpresent order
of knowledge as one defined by a Two Culture divide between</p>

<blockquote><p>the natural sciences, on the one hand (whose domains comprise the
physicalcosmos, as well as that of all biological life), and the
disciplines of the socialsciences and the humanities on the other
(Snow 1993). And although therehas been some attempt recently to rebut
the hypothesis of this divide, cen-trally among these the Gulbenkian
Report on the social sciences prepared bya team of scholars headed by
Immanuel Wallerstein and Valentin Mudimbe(1994), the fact remains that
while the natural sciences can explain and pre-dict, to a large
extent, the behaviors of these nonhuman worlds, the disci-plines of
the social sciences and humanities still remain unable to explainand
predict the parameters of the ensemble of collective behaviors that
areinstituting of our contemporary world---to explain, therefore, the
why notonly of the large-scale inequalities, but also of the overall
Janus-faced effectsof large-scale human emancipation yoked to the no
less large-scale humandegradation and immiseration to which these
behaviors collectively lead.These behaviors, whether oriented by the
residual metaphysics offertility/reproduction of the agrarian age in
the poorer parts of the world, orby the metaphysics of productivity
and profitability of our techno-industrialone in the rich
enclaves---with the one impelling the dynamics of overpopu-lation, and
the other that of overconsumption---now collectively threaten
theplanetary environment of our human-species habitat.\
The Argument proposes, in this context, that the still
unbreachabledivide between the &quot;Two Cultures&quot;---a divide that had been
briefly chal-lenged by the range of anticolonial as well as the social
cum intellectualmovements of the sixties, before these movements were
re-coopted---lies inthe fact that our own disciplines (as literary
scholars and social scientistswhose domain is our sociohuman world)
must still continue to function, asall human orders of knowledge have
done from our origin on the continentof Africa until today, as a
language-capacitated form of life, to ensure thatwe continue to know
our present order of social reality, and rigorously so, inthe adaptive
&quot;truth-for&quot; terms needed to conserve our present descriptivestatement.
That is, as one that defines us biocentrically on the model of
anatural organism, with this a priori definition serving to orient and
motivatethe individual and collective behaviors by means of which our

<p>units, are stably produced and reproduced. This at the same time as
itensures that we, as Western and westernized intellectuals, continue to
artic-ulate, in however radically oppositional a manner, the rules of
the socialorder and its sanctioned theories (Konrad and Szelenyi 1979).\
Recent and still ongoing scholarship on archaeo-astronomy has shownthat
all human orders---from the smallest society of nomadic
hunter-gath-erers, such as the San people of the Kalahari, to the
large-scale societies ofEgypt, China, the Greeks, and the Romans---have
mapped their &quot;descriptivestatements&quot; or governing master codes on the
heavens, on their stable peri-odicities and regular recurring movements
(Krupp 1997). Because, in doingso, they had thereby mapped their
specific criterion of being human, of whatit was &quot;to be a good man and
woman of one&#39;s kind&quot; (Davis 1992), onto thephysical cosmos, thereby
absolutizing each such criterion; and with thisenabling them to be
experienced by each order&#39;s subjects as if they had beensupernaturally
(and, as such, extrahumanly) determined criteria, theirrespective truths
had necessarily come to function as an &quot;objective set offacts&quot; for the
people of that society---seeing that such truths were now
theindispensable condition of their existence as such a society, as such
people,as such a mode of being human. These truths had therefore both
com-manded obedience and necessitated the individual and collective
behaviorsby means of which each such order and its mode of being human
werebrought into existence, produced, and stably reproduced. This,
therefore,meant that all such knowledges of the physical cosmos, all
such astronomies,all such geographies, whatever the vast range of human
needs that they hadsuccessfully met, the range of behaviors they had
made possible---indeed,however sophisticated and complex the
calculations that they had enabledto be made of the movements of the
heavens (as in the case of Egypt andChina)---had still remained adaptive
truths-for and, as such, ethno-astronomies, ethno-geographies.\
This was no less the case with respect to the long tradition of
Greek/Hellenistic astronomy, which a medieval Judeo-Christian Europe
would haveinherited. Since, in spite of the great advances in
mathematical astronomyto which its fundamental Platonic postulate (that
of an eternal, &quot;divinized&quot;cosmos as contrasted with the Earth, which was
not only subject to change</p>

<blockquote><p>and corruption, but was fixed and unmoving at the center) has led a
longline of astronomers to struggle to &quot;save the phenomena&quot; (i.e., to
reconciletheir measurements of the movements of the heavens with this
premise),Greek astronomy was to remain an ethno-astronomy. One, that
is, in whichthe moral/political laws of the Greek polis had been
projected upon thephysical cosmos, enabling them to serve as
&quot;objective truth&quot; in Feyerabend&#39;s(1987) sense of the term, and
therefore as, in my own terms, adaptive truth-for the Greeks. With the
consequence that their projected premise of a valuedistinction and
principle of ontological distinction between heaven andearth had
functioned to analogically replicate and absolutize the
centralorder-organizing principle and genre-of-the-human distinction
at the levelof the sociopolitical order, between the non-dependent
masters who wereGreek-born citizens and their totally dependent slaves
classified as barbar-ian Others. With this value distinction
(sociogenic principle or master codeof symbolic life/death) then being
replicated at the level of the intra-Greeksociety, in gendered terms
(correlatedly), as between males, who were citi-zens, and women, who
were their dependents.\
In a 1987 interview, the theoretical physicist David Bohm explained
whythe rise of the physical sciences would have been impossible in
ancientGreece, given the role that the physical cosmos had been made
to play in sta-bilizing and legitimating the structures/hierarchies
and role allocations ofits social order. If each society, Bohm pointed
out, bases itself on a generalnotion of the world that always contains
within it &quot;a specific idea of order,&quot;for the ancient Greeks, this idea
of order had been projected as that of an&quot;increasing perfection from
the earth to the heavens.&quot; In consequence, inorder for modern physics
(which is based on the &quot;idea of successive posi-tions of bodies of
matter and the constraints of forces that act on these bod-ies&quot;) to be
developed, the &quot;order of perfection investigated by the ancientGreeks&quot;
had to become irrelevant. In other words, for such an astronomyand
physics to be developed, the society that made it possible would have
tobe one that no longer had the need to map its ordering principle
onto thephysical cosmos, as the Greeks and all other human societies
had done. Thesame goes for the need to retain the Greek premise of an
ontological differ-ence of substance between the celestial realm of
perfection (the realm of</p>

<p>true knowledge) and the imperfect realm of the terrestrial (the realm
ofdoxa, of mere opinion).\
This was not a mutation that could be easily effected. In his recent
book<em>The Enigma of the Gift</em> (1999), Maurice Godelier reveals an added
and evenmore powerful dimension as to why the mutation by which humans
wouldcease to map the &quot;idea of order&quot; onto the lawlike regularities of
physicalnature would not be easily come by. This would come to be
effected only inthe wake of the Renaissance humanists&#39; initiation of the
processes thatwould lead to the degodding/de-supernaturalizing of our
modes of beinghuman on the basis of their invention of Man in the
reoccupied place oftheir earlier matrix theocentric identity,
Christian.\
Although, Godelier writes, as human beings who live in society, and
whomust also produce society in order to live, we have hitherto always
done soby producing, at the same time, the mechanisms by means of which
we havebeen able to invert cause and effect, allowing us to repress the
recognitionof our collective production of our modes of social reality
(and with it, the Argument proposes, the recognition also of the
self-inscripted, auto-instituted nature of our genres/modes of being
human). Central to thesemechanisms was the one by which we projected our
own authorship of oursocieties onto the ostensible extrahuman agency of
supernatural ImaginaryBeings (Godelier 1999). This imperative has been
total in the case of allhuman orders (even where in the case of our now
purely secular order, theextrahuman agency on which our authorship is
now projected is no longersupernatural, but rather that of
Evolution/Natural Selection together withits imagined entity of &quot;Race&quot;).
As if, in our contemporary case, Evolution,which pre-adapted us by means
of the co-evolution of language and thebrain to self-inscript and
auto-institute our modes of being human, and tothereby artificially
program our own behaviors---doing so, as the biologistJames Danielli
pointed out in a 1980 essay, by means of the discourses of reli-gion, as
well as of the secular ones that have now taken their
place---stillcontinued to program our hybrid ontogeny/sociogeny
behaviors by means ofunmediated genetic programs. Rather than, as
Danielli further argued, allsuch behaviors being lawlikely induced by
discursively instituted programswhose good/evil formulations function to

whilecommon to all species, functions in the case of humans in terms
specific toeach such narratively inscribed and discursively elaborated
descriptivestatement and, thereby, to its mode of the &quot;I&quot; and
correlated symboli-cally/altruistically bonded mode of the eusocial
&quot;we&quot; (Danielli 1980). If, as David Bohm pointed out, the Greeks&#39; &quot;idea
of order&quot; had beenmapped upon degrees of perfection, projected upon
the physical cosmos asdegrees of rational perfection extending from
the apex of the heavens&#39;degrees to the nonhomogenous nadir of the
earth&#39;s---with the rise, in thewake of the collapse of the Roman
Empire, of a now Judeo-Christian Europe,while the classical
Greco-Roman (i.e., Ptolemaic) astronomy that had givenexpression to
the Greek idea of order was to be carried over---it was to
beChristianized within the terms of Judeo-Christianity&#39;s new
&quot;descriptivestatement&quot; of the human, based on its master code of the
&quot;Redeemed Spirit&quot;(as actualized in the celibate clergy) and the
&quot;Fallen Flesh&quot; enslaved to thenegative legacy of Adamic Original Sin,
as actualized by laymen and women.Hence the logic by which medieval
Latin-Christian Europe&#39;s &quot;notion of theworld&quot; and &quot;idea of order&quot;
would become one of degrees of spiritual perfec-tion, at the same time
as it would remain mapped onto the same &quot;space ofOtherness&quot; principle
of nonhomogeneity (Godzich 1986). With the resultthat on the basis of
this projection, the medieval Latin-Christian subject&#39;ssensory
perception of a motionless earth would have &quot;verified&quot; for them
notonly the postulate of mankind&#39;s justly condemned enslavement to the
nega-tive Adamic legacy, but, even more centrally, the &quot;sinful by
nature&quot; descrip-tive statement of the human in whose terms they both
experiencedthemselves as Christians, being thereby behaviorally
impelled to seekredemption from their enslavement through the
sacraments of the Church,as well as by adhering to its prohibitions,
and to thereby strive to attain toits otherworldly goal---that of
Divine Election for eternal salvation in theAugustinian civitas dei
(the city of God).\
Central to Winant&#39;s &quot;immense historical rupture,&quot; therefore, was the
con-ceptual break made with the Greco-Roman cum Judeo-Christian
premise ofa nonhomogeneity of substance, and thereby of an ontological
distinctionbetween the supralunar and the sublunar, heaven and earth,
as the break</p>

<p>that was to make possible the rise of a nonadaptive, and therefore
natural-scientific, mode of cognition with respect to the &quot;objective set
of facts&quot; of thephysical level of reality: with respect to what was
happening &quot;out there.&quot; Thefifteenth-century voyages of the Portuguese
(to and around Africa, then tothe East), as well as Columbus&#39;s voyages
across an until-then held to be (byWestern Europeans) non-navigable
Atlantic Ocean (since both of theseareas, Black Africa and the Americas,
had been held to be uninhabitable, theone because too hot, the other
because under water, with both being outsideGod&#39;s providential Grace)
were themselves expressions of the same overallprocess of
self-transformation. This as the process that, internal to late-medieval
Latin-Christian Europe, was to underpin the rise of the modernpolitical
city and monarchical states of Europe, and that (together with anongoing
commercial revolution) were to effectively displace the theologi-cally
absolute hegemony of the Church, together with that of its
celibateclergy, over the lay or secular world, replacing it with that of
their (i.e. themonarchical states&#39;) politically absolute own. The new
conceptual ground ofthis reversal had, however, been made possible only
on the basis of the intel-lectual revolution of Renaissance
humanists---a revolution that, while alliedto the Reform movement of
Christian humanism, was mounted in large partfrom the
counter-perspective of the lay intelligentsia. From the
viewpoint,therefore, of the category whose members had until then been
compelled tothink and work within the very theocentric paradigms that
legitimated thedominance of the post-Gregorian Reform Church and its
celibate clergy (thename clergy means, in Greek, the chosen) over the
lay world---as these par-adigms had been elaborated in the context of
the then hegemonic Scholasticorder of knowledge of medieval Europe.\
This theological condemnation of the &quot;natural man&quot; of the laity
hadbecome even more intensified by medieval Scholasticism&#39;s reconception
ofthe human in Aristotelian Unmoved/Mover terms. Its Omnipotent God
hadcreated the world for the sake of His Own Glory, thereby creating
mankindonly contingently and without any consideration for its own sake
(propternos homines/for our human sake), had left it, in the wake of the
Adamic Falland its subsequent enslavement to the Fallen Flesh, without
any hope ofbeing able to have any valid knowledge of reality except
through the media-</p>

<blockquote><p>tion of the very paradigms that excluded any such hope. Given that it
wasprecisely these theologically absolute paradigms that, by
circularly verifyingthe &quot;sinful by nature&quot; cognitive incapacity of
fallen mankind, served at thesame time to validate both the hegemony
of the Church and of the celibateclergy over the lay world, including
the state, as well as the hegemony of thesupratemporal perspective of
the Church (based on its represented access toDivine Eternal Truth)
over any knowledge generated from the local, tempo-ral, and
this-worldly perspective of a lay world ostensibly entrapped in
thefallen time of the secular realm, this thereby subjected mankind to
the insta-bility and chaos of the capricious whims of Fortune (Pocock
1989).\
The lay intelligentsia of medieval Europe had, therefore, found
them-selves in a situation in whose context, in order to be learned
and accom-plished scholars, they had had to be accomplices in the
production of a&quot;politics of truth&quot; that subordinated their own lay
world and its perspectiveon reality to that of the Church and of the
clergy. Accomplices also in thecontinued theoretical elaboration of a
theocentric descriptive statement ofthe human, in whose terms they
were always already the embodied bearersof its postulate of
&quot;significant ill&quot;---that of enslavement to Original Sin---an&quot;ill&quot;
curable or redeemable only through the mediation of the Church andthe
clergy, and circularly, through that of the theologically absolute
para-digms that verified the hegemony of the latter.\
The manifesto (put forward from the perspective of the laity) that was
tomake possible the rupture in whose terms the Copernican Revolution
andthe new epoch that would become that of the modern world were to
bemade possible was that of the fifteenth-century treatise by the
Italianhumanist Pico della Mirandola (1463‒1494) entitled <em>Oration on
the Dignity ofMan</em>. In this treatise, Pico rewrote the Judeo-Christian
origin narrative ofGenesis. Adam, rather than having been placed in
the Garden of Eden, thenhaving fallen, then having been expelled with
Eve from the garden by God,is shown by Pico to have not fallen at all.
Instead, he had come into existencewhen God, having completed his
Creation and wanting someone to admireHis works, had created Man on a
model unique to him, then placed him atthe center/midpoint of the
hierarchy of this creation, commanding him to&quot;make of himself&quot; what he
willed to be---to decide for himself whether to fall</p>

<p>to the level of the beasts by giving into his passions, or, through the
use ofhis reason, to rise to the level of the angels (See Pico&#39;s
guide-quote). It wastherefore to be on the basis of this new conception,
and of its related civic-humanist reformulation, that Man was to be
invented in its first form as therational political subject of the
state, as one who displayed his reason by pri-marily adhering to the
laws of the state---rather than, as before, in seekingto redeem himself
from enslavement to Original Sin by primarily adheringto the
prohibitions of the Church.\
Two strategies were made use of in order to effect this epochal
degod-ding (if, at first, only in hybridly religio-secular terms) of the
&quot;descriptivestatement&quot; in whose terms humans inscript and institute
themselves/our-selves as this or that genre of being human. The strategy
was that of a return:the return by the humanists to Greco-Roman thought,
to (in the case ofPico) the Jewish mystical tradition of the Kabbalah,
as well as to the evenearlier Egyptian thought as transmitted through
these latter, in order to findboth a space outside the terms of the
medieval order&#39;s &quot;descriptive state-ment&quot; and an alternative model on
which to reinvent the matrix optimallyRedeemed-in-the-Spirit Self of the
Christian, the &quot;subject of the church,&quot; asthat of the Rational Self of
Man as political subject of the state. While it wasthe revalorization of
natural man that was implicit in this overall return tothe Greco-Roman
and other pre-Christian thought, and models by Renais-sance humanists
such as Ficino and Pico, as Fernand Hallyn (1990) has pro-posed, that
was to make possible Copernicus&#39;s intellectual challenge to
theontological distinction between the supralunar and sublunar realms of
thecosmos: to its foundational premise of a nonhomogeneity of
substancebetween them.\
Why was this the case? Within the terms of the medieval order&#39;s
theo-centric conception of the relation between a totally Omnipotent God
andcontingently created humans, the latter could not attempt to gain
validknowledge of physical reality by basing him/herself on the
regularity of itslaws of functioning. Seeing that God, as an absolute
and unbound God,could arbitrarily intervene in the accustomed course of
nature (cursus soli-tus naturae) in order to alter its processes of
functioning, by means of mir-acles, at any time He wished to do so. It
was therefore to be, as Hallyn</p>

rela-tion between natural man and a Christian God, reconceived as a
CaringFather who had created the universe specifically for man&#39;s sake
(propter noshomines, for our human sake), that provided the
counter-ground for theCopernican rupture with the orthodox
Christianized astronomy that hadbeen inherited from the Greeks. It was
the new premise that God had cre-ated the world/universe for mankind&#39;s
sake, as a premise that ensured thatHe would have had to make it
according to rational, nonarbitrary rules thatcould be knowable by the
beings that He had made it for, that would lead toCopernicus&#39;s
declaration (against the epistemological resignation ofPtolemaic
astronomy, which said that such knowledge was not available formere
mortals) that since the universe had been made for our sake by the
bestand wisest of master craftsmen, it had to be knowable (see
Copernicusguide-quote).\
In his book <em>The Medieval Imagination</em>, Jacques Le Goff analyzes the
wayin which the medieval order of Latin-Christian Europe had organized
itselfabout a value principle or master code that had been actualized
in theempirical relation between the celibate category of the clergy
(as the embod-iment of the Spirit, and the noncelibate category of the
1aity (as the embod-iment of the Fallen Flesh). This Spirit/Flesh code
had then been projectedonto the physical cosmos, precisely onto the
represented nonhomogeneity ofsubstance between the spiritual
perfection of the heavens (whose supralu-nar bodies were imagined to
move in harmonious and perfectly circularmotions) as opposed to the
sublunar realm of Earth, which, as the abode ofa post-Adamic fallen
mankind, had to be at the center of the universe as itsdregs---and, in
addition, to be not only nonmoving as it is sensed by us tobe, but to
be so because divinely condemned to be nonmoving in the wakeof the
Fall. However, it was not only the Earth that had to be known in
theseadaptive truth-for terms, within the conceptual framework of the
Christian-Ptolemaic astronomy of the time. The geography of the earth
had also hadto be known in parallel Spirit/Flesh terms as being
divided up between, onthe one hand, its temperate regions centered on
Jerusalem---regions that,because held up above the element of water by
God&#39;s Providential Grace,were habitable---and, on the other, those
realms that, because outside this</p>

<p>Grace, had to be uninhabitable. Before the fifteenth-century voyages of
thePortuguese and Columbus, which disproved this premise of the
nonhomo-geneity of the earth&#39;s geography, the Torrid Zone beyond the
bulge of CapeBojador on the upper coast of Africa had therefore had to
be known as toohot for habitation, while the Western hemisphere had had
to be known asbeing devoid of land, seeing that all land there had to
remain, in the frame-work of Christian Aristotelian physics, submerged
in its &quot;natural place&quot;under water, since ostensibly not held
&quot;unnaturally&quot; above the water byDivine Grace.\
This series of symbolically coded Spirit/Flesh representations
mappedupon the &quot;space of Otherness&quot; of the physical cosmos had not only
func-tioned to absolutize the theocentric descriptive statement of the
human, itsmaster code of symbolic life (the Spirit) and death (the
Flesh), together withthat statement&#39;s overall explanatory thesis of
supernatural causation. It hadalso served to absolutize &quot;a general order
of existence,&quot; together with its&quot;postulate of significant ill,&quot; whose
mode of affliction then logically calls forthe particular &quot;plan of
salvation&quot; or redemptive cure able to cure the specific&quot;ill&quot; that
threatened all the subjects of the order, in order to redeem themfrom
its threat of nihilation/negation that is common to all
religions(Girardot 1988). Now in specific Judeo-Christian formulation,
the postulateof &quot;significant ill&quot; had, of course, been that of mankind&#39;s
enslavement toOriginal Sin, with his/her fallen state placing him/her
outside God&#39;s Grace,except when redeemed from this &quot;ill&quot; by the
sacrament of baptism as admin-istered by the clergy. While this
behavior-motivating schema had itself alsobeen anchored on the
Spirit/Flesh, inside/outside God&#39;s Grace, ill/cure sys-tem of symbolic
representations attached to the represented supra/sublunarnonhomogeneity
of substance of the physical cosmos, as well as to the
hab-itable/uninhabitable geography of the earth.\
Here the Argument identifies Girardot&#39;s schemas as ones that also
func-tion beyond the limits of original religious modalities, seeing
them insteadin the terms of Danielli&#39;s hypothesis as forms of the
central, behavior-moti-vating/-demotivating, discursive, good/evil
postulates, able to activate thebiochemical reward and punishment
mechanism---and, therefore, as thecentral &quot;machinery of programming&quot;
that is common to all human orders,</p>

<blockquote><p>whether religious or secular. In consequence, whether religious or
secular, allsuch schemas/programs and their formulations of &quot;a general
order of exis-tence&quot; also function to inscribe the specific
&quot;descriptive statement&quot; of thehuman that is enacting of the
ontogeny/sociogeny, nature-culture mode ofbeing human, for whom the
specific ensemble of motivated behaviors will beadaptively
advantageous. In this conceptual framework it can therefore
berecognized that it was in the context of the humanists&#39; redescribing
of theChristian definition of the human---in new, revalorizing, and
(so to speak)propter nos homines and/or Man-centric terms---that the
series of fifteenth-century voyages on whose basis the West began its
global expansion voyages(one of which proved that the earth was
homogeneously habitable byhumans, seeing that the Torrid Zone was
indeed inhabited, as was that ofthe land of the Western hemisphere
that turned out to be above water),together with Copernicus&#39;s new
astronomy (which proposed that the earthalso moved about the Sun,
projected as the center, and was therefore of thesame substance as,
homogeneous with, the heavenly bodies), were to initi-ate the rupture
that would lead to the rise of the physical sciences. Thereby,to a new
order of cognition in which &quot;the objective set of facts&quot; of the
phys-ical level of reality was now to be gradually freed from having
to be knownin the adaptive terms of a truth-for specific to each
order, as they had beenmillennially---to be known as they were and are
&quot;out there.&quot;\
What needs to be emphasized here is, firstly, that the two orthodox
pre-suppositions that were now to be swept away---that of the
nonhomogeneityof the geography of the earth and that of the
nonhomogeneity of the earth andthe heavens---had been ones
indispensable to the conservation of themedieval order&#39;s theocentric
descriptive statement of the human. Secondly, ithad been the
reinvention by the lay humanists of the Renaissance of thematrix
identity Christian in terms of the new descriptive statement of Man
aspolitical subject, allied to the historical rise and expansion of
the modernstate (for whom, eventually, these earlier orthodox
presuppositions, theirtruth-fors, were expendable, because no longer
of any adaptive advantage toits own instituting as such a mode of
being human), that had made the sweep-ing away of the earlier
unquestioned principles of nonhomogeneity possible.</p>

<p>This sweeping away led a later Isaac Newton to exult that, because it
had nowbeen shown that all parts of the universe were made of the same
forces, of thesame matter, one could now be able to extrapolate from the
bodies nearest tous, and on the analogy of nature always consonant with
itself, what the bod-ies furthest from us had necessarily to be
(Funkenstein 1986).\
To sum up: this means that the epochal rupture that was set in motionby
Western intellectuals, by means of which human knowledge of the
phys-ical cosmos would be freed from having to be known in the adaptive
truth-for terms that had been hitherto indispensable to the instituting
of allhuman orders and their respective modes/genres of being
human---the rup-ture that was to lead to the gradual development of the
physical sciences---had been made possible only by the no less epochal
reinvention of WesternEurope&#39;s matrix Judeo-Christian genre of the
human, in its first secularizingif still hybridly religio-secular terms
as Man as the Rational Self and politi-cal subject of the state, in the
reoccupied place of the True Christian Self, ormode of sociogeny, of
Latin-Christian Europe; by the reinvention also of thesecular entity of
the West in the reoccupied place of the latter, with this rein-vention
being based on the model of Virgil&#39;s Roman imperial epic.\
This takes us back to the negative aspect of the dialectical process of
cul-ture-historical transformation by which the West was to initiate the
firstphase of the degodding of its descriptive statement of the human,
therebyalso initiating the processes that were to lead to the
development of the neworder of nonadaptive cognition that is the natural
sciences. Since it was tobe in the specific terms of this
reinvention---one in which while, asChristians, the peoples of the West
would see themselves as one religiousgenre of the human, even where they
were to be convinced that theirs wasthe only true religion, and indeed,
as Lyotard points out, were unable to con-ceive of an Other to what they
called God---as Man, they would now not onlycome to overrepresent their
conception of the human (by means of a sus-tained rhetorical strategy
based on the topos of iconicity [Valesio 1980]) asthe human, thereby
coming to invent, label, and institutionalize the indige-nous peoples of
the Americas as well as the transported enslaved BlackAfricans as the
physical referent of the projected irrational/subrational</p>

<blockquote><p>Human Other to its civic-humanist, rational self-conception. The
Westwould therefore remain unable, from then on, to conceive of an
Other towhat it calls human---an Other, therefore, to its correlated
postulates ofpower, truth, freedom. All other modes of being human
would instead haveto be seen not as the alternative modes of being
human that they are &quot;outthere,&quot; but adaptively, as the lack of the
West&#39;s ontologically absolute self-description. This at the same time
as its genuine difference from all others(i.e., its secularizing
reinvention of its matrix religious identity from theRenaissance
onwards as that of Man in two forms---one ratiocentric and
stillhybridly religio-secular, the other purely secular and
biocentric) wouldremain overseen, even non-theorizable within the
acultural premise onwhose basis it had effected the reinvention of its
matrix Christian genre ortheological &quot;descriptive statement&quot; of the
human.\
This central oversight would then enable both Western and
westernizedintellectuals to systemically repress what Geertz has
identified as the &quot;fugi-tive truth&quot; of its own &quot;local culturality&quot;
(Geertz 1983)---of, in Bruno Latour&#39;sterms, its specific &quot;constitution
with a capital C,&quot; or cultural constitutionthat underlies and charters
our present order, as the parallel constitutions ofall other human
orders that Western anthropologists have brilliantly eluci-dated
underlie and charter all other human orders (Latour 1991)---doing
soaccording to the same hybrid nature-culture, ontogeny/sociogeny laws
orrules. With this systemic repression ensuring that we oversee
(thereby fail-ing to recognize) the culture and class-specific
relativity of our present modeof being human: Man in the second,
transumed, and now purely biocentricand homo oeconomicus form of that
first invention that was to lead toWinant&#39;s &quot;immense historical
rupture,&quot; to Quijano&#39;s &quot;Racism/Ethnicism&quot;complex, and to Mignolo&#39;s
modernity/coloniality complementarity.\
What were the specific terms of that first reinvention? Of its
overrepre-sentation? Why were these terms to lie at the basis of the
Las Casas/Sepúlveda dispute, whose empirical outcome---in favor of the
latter&#39;shumanist arguments as opposed to Las Casas&#39;s still
theologically groundedones---was to provide the legitimated &quot;ground&quot;
for what was to become thecolonizer (both the metropolitan

<p>Two different anthropologies and their respective origin
models/narrativeshad inscribed two different descriptive statements of
the human, onewhich underpinned the evangelizing mission of the
Church, the other theimperializing mission of the state based on its
territorial expansion andconquest. Nevertheless, rather than merely a
Christian/classics opposition,the second descriptive statement, that
of &quot;Man&quot; as political subject of thestate, was to be instead a
syncretized synthesis of the anthropology of theclassics drawn into a
secularizing Judeo-Christian framework, and there-fore into the field
of what Latour would call the West&#39;s &quot;constitution witha capital C.&quot;\
This syncretism had already been at work in the formulations of
Ficinoand Pico della Mirandola. For the latter, classical thought had
enabled him,as part of his revalorizing strategy of natural man, to
fuse the original Judeo-Christian conception of the human as being
made in the image of God, withthe view of Platonic philosophy in which
man is defined by the fact of thechoice that he can give himself to
adopt &quot;the sensual life of an animal or thephilosophical life of the
gods.&quot; Ficino had also defined man in terms derivedfrom both Christian
and Platonic, as well as other pre-Christian sources asa creature

<p>world of the angels of God&quot;: as balanced between &quot;natural&quot; and
&quot;supernatu-ral&quot; order. It was in the context of this syncretized
reinscription that the newcriterion of Reason would come to take the
place of the medieval criterionof the Redeemed Spirit as its transumed
form---that the master code of sym-bolic life (&quot;the name of what is
good&quot;) and death (&quot;the name of what is evil&quot;)would now become that of
reason/sensuality, rationality/irrationality in thereoccupied place of
the matrix code of Redeemed Spirit/Fallen Flesh. Thedescriptive
statement instituting of the humanists&#39; Man would therefore usethe
Judeo-Christian answer to the what and who we are (i.e., the
&quot;humancreated in the image of God,&quot; but later become the embodiment of
OriginalSin) to revalorize the medieval order&#39;s fallen natural man by
proposing that,because &quot;God is included in man in that an image embodies
and includes itsexemplar,&quot; human reason had remained &quot;lord over the
senses similar to theway in which God is lord over his creatures.&quot;\
The relation here is one of analogy. While reason is not a god, &quot;it
par-takes of some of God&#39;s functions&quot; in that it is intended to rule
over a &quot;lowerorder of reality.&quot; The fundamental separation for Pico was
one between twoorders of creation, with man placed by God at the
midpoint between them.These were, on the one hand, the &quot;super-celestial&quot;
regions with minds (i.e.,angels, pure intelligences), and on the other,
a region &quot;filled with a diversethrong of animals, the cast off and
residual parts of the lower world.&quot; Placedbetween these two realms, man
was the only creature &quot;confined by nobounds,&quot; free to &quot;fix limits of
nature&quot; for himself, free to be &quot;molder andmaker of himself&quot; (see Pico&#39;s
guide-quote). Rather than the medievalChristian&#39;s choice of remaining
enslaved to the Fallen Flesh and to OriginalSin, or seeking to be
Redeemed-in-the-Spirit through the sacraments of theChurch, this newly
invented Man&#39;s choice is that of either growing down-wards into the
lower natures of brutes, or responding to the Creator&#39;s call togrow
&quot;upward&quot; to &quot;higher&quot; and &quot;divine&quot; natures (Miller 1965).\
With this redescription, the medieval world&#39;s idea of order as based
upondegrees of spiritual perfection/imperfection, an idea of order
centered onthe Church, was now to be replaced by a new one based upon
degrees ofrational perfection/imperfection. And this was to be the new
&quot;idea of order&quot;on whose basis the coloniality of being, enacted by the

<blockquote><p>tion between Man---overrepresented as the generic, ostensibly
supraculturalhuman---and its subjugated Human Others (i.e., Indians
and Negroes),together with, as Quijano notes, the continuum of new
categories of humans(i.e., mestizos and mulattos to which their
human/subhuman value differ-ence gave rise), was to be brought into
existence as the foundational basis ofmodernity. With this revealing
that, from the very origin, the issue of race,as the issue of the
Colonial Question, the Nonwhite/Native Question, theNegro Question,
yet as one that has hitherto had no name, was and is fun-damentally
the issue of the genre of the human, Man, in its two variants---the
issue of its still ongoing production/reproduction in the form of
thesecond variant.\
The clash between Las Casas and Sepúlveda was a clash over this
issue---the clash as to whether the primary generic identity should
continue to bethat of Las Casas&#39;s theocentric Christian, or that of
the newly invented Manof the humanists, as the rational (or
ratiocentric) political subject of thestate (the latter as the
&quot;descriptive statement&quot; in whose terms Sepúlvedaspoke). And this clash
was to be all the more deep-seated in that the human-ists, while going
back to the classics and to other pre-Christian sources inorder to
find a model of being human alternative to the one in whose termsthe
lay world was necessarily subordinated, had effected their now new
con-ception and its related &quot;formulation of a general order of
existence&quot; only bytransuming that of the Church&#39;s matrix
Judeo-Christian conception, therebycarrying over the latter&#39;s
schematic structure, as well as many of its residualmeanings.\
In this transumed reformulation, while the &quot;significant ill&quot; of
mankind&#39;senslavement was no longer projected as being to the negative
legacy ofAdamic Original Sin, the concept of enslavement was carried
over andredescribed as being, now, to the irrational aspects of
mankind&#39;s humannature. This redescription had, in turn, enabled the
new behavior-motivating&quot;plan of salvation&quot; to be secularized in the
political terms of the this-worldlygoals of the state. Seeing that
because the &quot;ill&quot; or &quot;threat&quot; was now that offinding oneself enslaved
to one&#39;s passions, to the particularistic desires ofone&#39;s human
nature, salvation/redemption could only be found by the sub-ject able
to subdue his private interests in order to adhere to the laws of the</p>

<p>politically absolute state, and thereby to the &quot;common good.&quot; This
meantthat the primary behavior-motivating goal, rather than that of
seeking sal-vation in the civitas dei, was now that of adhering to the
goal of the civitassaecularis (Pocock 1975): the goal, that is, of
seeking to ensure the stability,order, and territorial expansion of the
state in a competitive rivalry withother European states. This at the
same time as the primacy of the earlierreligious ethic, as defended by
Las Casas from a universalistic Christian per-spective, was replaced by
the new ethic of &quot;reasons of state,&quot; as the ethic car-ried by a
Sepúlveda whose civic humanist values were still, at the time,
onlyincipiently emergent. However, it is the latter ethic that, given
the existen-tial sociopolitical and commercial, on-the-ground processes
that were tolead to the rapid rise of the centralizing state,8 to its
replacement of themedieval system-ensemble with its monarchical own
(Hubner 1983), and tothe expanding mercantilism with its extra-European
territorial conquests,exponentially accelerated was soon to triumph and
become the accepteddoctrine of the times.\
Nowhere is this mutation of ethics seen more clearly than in two
playswritten in the first decades of the seventeenth century: one the
well-knownplay by Shakespeare, <em>The Tempest</em>; the other the less
well-known play bySpain&#39;s Lope de Vega, written at roughly the same time
and entitled <em>The NewWorld Discovered by Christopher Columbus</em>. In the
plot of <em>The Tempest</em>, thecentral opposition is represented as being
between Prospero and Caliban;that is, between Higher Reason as expressed
in the former, and irrational,sensual nature as embodied in the latter.
The drunken sailors, Stephano andTrinculo, had also, like Caliban, been
shown as embodying that enslavementto the irrational aspects of human
nature (if to a lesser degree than the lat-ter) which Prospero must
repress in himself if he is to act as a rational ruler;that is, one for
whom the securing of the stability and order of the state (ineffect,
reasons-of-state) had now to be the overriding imperative, the
majorthis-worldly goal. And while Miranda as woman, and as a young girl,
isshown as poised at midpoint between rational and irrational nature,
she ispre-assured of attaining to the former status because of her
father&#39;s tutor-ing. This master code of rational nature/irrational

the one hand, to the&quot;irrational&quot; Moorish prince of Granada---who is
shown dallying with thesensual pleasures of love while Ferdinand and
Isabel capture Granada, dis-placing him (&quot;Orientalism&quot; has an even
longer history than Said hastraced!)---and on the other, and most
totally so,9 to the &quot;irrational&quot; becausetyrannical Arawak cacique who,
because of his forcible abduction of thebride-to-be of one of his
subjects, is shown to be as justly expropriated of hissovereignty, his
lands, and his religion as Caliban is &quot;justly&quot; expropriated ofhis in
The Tempest. In both plays, therefore, the Human Other figures to
thegeneric human embodied in Prospero and in the Catholic king and
queenare made to embody the postulate of &quot;significant ill&quot; of
enslavement to thelower, sensory aspects of &quot;human nature.&quot; At the
same time, the generichuman bearer-figures of the politically rational
are made to actualize thenew, transumed formulation and its conception
of freedom as having nolonger mastery over Original Sin (as well as
over those Enemies-of-Christwho as such remain enslaved to it), but
rather of mastery over their own sen-sory, irrational nature---and, as
well, of all those Human Other categorieswho, like Shakespeare&#39;s
Caliban and Lope de Vega&#39;s Dulcanquellín, are stig-matized as
remaining totally enslaved to theirs.\
But perhaps what Shakespeare&#39;s Reformation play reveals, more
clearlythan does Lope de Vega&#39;s Counter Reformation one, is the
profound shift inthe grounds of legitimacy of which Sepúlveda had been
the proponent in the1550s dispute with Las Casas, and that were now
being instituted in earlyseventeenth-century Western Europe. That is,
the shift in the terms by whichthe latter&#39;s ongoing expropriation of
New World lands and the subsequentreduction of the indigenous peoples
to being a landless, rightless,10 neo-serfwork force---together with
the accelerated mass slave trade out of Africa tothe Americas and the
Caribbean and the instituting of the large-scale slaveplantation
system that that trade made possible---will be made to seem justand
legitimate to its peoples. In addition, the way in which this shift

<p>linked to another shift (one by which Western Europe&#39;s categorization of
the&quot;Indians&quot; and &quot;Negroes&quot; in now secular rather than in the earlier
religiousterms of Otherness: the new terms, therefore, of Quijano&#39;s
&quot;Racism/Ethnicism&quot; complex) will be effected.\
As Valentin Mudimbe documents in his <em>The Invention of Africa</em>
(1988),beginning in 1444 with the Portuguese landfall on the shores of
Senegal WestAfrica, all the actions that were to be taken by
European-Christians---theirenslavement of non-Christians whom they first
classified in theologicalterms as Enemies-of-Christ, whether those of
Africa or those of the NewWorld, together with their expropriation of
the lands of the peoples on bothcontinents (limitedly so, at that time,
in the case of Africa; almost totally soin the case of the
Americas)---were initially seen as just and legitimate inChristian
theological terms. In these terms, all the concessions of non-European
lands by the pope to the Portuguese and Spanish sovereigns wereeffected
by means of several papal bulls that defined these lands as onesthat,
because not belonging to a Christian prince, were terra nullius
(&quot;thelands of no one&quot;), and so legitimately expropriated by Christian
kings(Mudimbe 1988). In other words, they were so seen within the terms
of theadaptive truth-for of their &quot;local culture&#39;s&quot; still hegemonic
descriptive state-ment of the human, and of the order of knowledge to
which that statementgave rise. And, therefore, as the truth of the
&quot;single culture&quot; in whose theo-centric terms they thought and acted
(Epstein 1993), whose truth theybelieved to be as supernaturally
ordained as we now believe ours to be&quot;objective&quot; because, ostensibly,
supraculturally true.\
This means that the large-scale accumulation of unpaid land,
unpaidlabor, and overall wealth expropriated by Western Europe from
non-European peoples, which was to lay the basis of its global expansion
fromthe fifteenth century onwards, was carried out within the order of
truth andthe self-evident order of consciousness, of a creed-specific
conception ofwhat it was to be human---which, because a monotheistic
conception, couldnot conceive of an Other to what it experienced as
being human, and there-fore an Other to its truth, its notion of
freedom. Its subjects could thereforesee the new peoples whom it
encountered in Africa and the New World onlyas the &quot;pagan-idolators,&quot; as
&quot;Enemies-of-Christ&quot; as the Lack of its own nar-</p>

secularizing rein-vention of its own matrix Christian identity as Man.
The non-Europeansthat the West encountered as it expanded would
classify the West as &quot;abnor-mal&quot; relative to their own experienced
Norm of being human, in theOtherness slot of the gods or the
ancestors. This was the case with theCongolese who, seeing the white
skin of the Europeans as a sign of mon-strous deviance to their Bantu
genre/norm of being human, classified themtogether with their deceased
ancestors (Axelson 1970). For the Europeans,however, the only
available slot of Otherness to their Norm, into which theycould
classify these non-European populations, was one that defined the
lat-ter in terms of their ostensible subhuman status (Sahlins 1995).\
The creation of this secular slot of Otherness as a replacement for
thetheocentric slot of Otherness in which non-European peoples had
been clas-sified in religious terms as Enemies-of-Christ,
pagan-idolators, therebyincorporating them into the theological system
of legitimacy---which, as setout in the papal bulls from the 1455
Romanus Pontifex onwards, had pro-vided the framework in whose terms
their ostensibly &quot;lands of no one/terranullius&quot; had been seeable as
justly expropriable, and they themselves justlyenslavable as such
pre-classified populations---was taking place, however, inthe wider
context of the overall sociopolitical and cultural transformationthat
had been set in motion in Western Europe from the Renaissanceonwards,
one correlated with the challenge of the then ascendant modernEuropean
monarchical state to the centralizing post-Gregorian hegemony ofthe
Church.\
In this context, Anthony Pagden has excellently documented the
shiftthat would eventually take place in the grounds of legitimacy in
whose termsEuropeans were to see themselves as justly expropriating
the lands and liv-ing space of the indigenous peoples of the New
World. This shift, as heshows, would occur as a direct result of the
fact that while, at first, theSpanish state had depended on the pope&#39;s
having divided up the New Worldbetween Spain and Portugal, doing this
in exchange for the promise thattheir respective states would help to
further the evangelizing mission ofChristianity, the Spanish
sovereigns had soon become impatient with thepapacy&#39;s claim to
temporal as well as to spiritual sovereignty. In conse-</p>

<p>quence, King Ferdinand of Spain, wanting to claim temporal sovereignty
forhimself as he set out to institute the first Western European world
empire,had summoned several councils comprised of jurists and
theologians. Hehad then given them the mandate that they should come up
with newgrounds for Spain&#39;s sovereignty, which moved outside the limits
of the sov-ereignty over the temporal world claimed by the papacy.\
The fact that the theological grounds of the legitimacy both of
Spain&#39;ssovereignty over the New World and of its settlers&#39; rights to the
indigenouspeople&#39;s lands (as well as of the latter&#39;s right, in the early
period, to carry outslave-trading raids on the American mainland) had
come upon a centralobstacle made this matter all the more urgent. The
obstacle was this: all thebasic concepts of the theological system of
legitimation---i.e., that the landsof non-Christian princes were terra
nullius and as such justly expropriableby Christian princes; that the
indigenous peoples could be enserfed or evenenslaved where
necessary---had come to founder upon a stubborn fact. Thiswas that the
indigenous peoples of the New World could not be classified
asEnemies-of-Christ, since Christ&#39;s apostles had never reached the New
World,never preached the Word of the Gospel to them. Which meant that
becausethey could not have ever refused to hear the Word, they could not
(withinthe terms of the orthodox theology of the Church) be classified
as Christ-Refusers, their lands justly taken, and they themselves
enslaved and/orenserfed with a &quot;just title.&quot;\
The life-long struggle of Bartolomé de Las Casas, the Spanish
mission-ary priest, in the wake of his 1514 conversion experience, to
save theCaribbean Arawaks from the ongoing demographic catastrophe that
fol-lowed both their infection by new diseases to which they had no
immunityand their subjection to the harsh, forced-labor regime of the
Spaniards wasa struggle waged precisely on the basis of the fact that
such subjection couldnot be carried out with a &quot;just title.&quot; This was,
therefore, to lead him to makea fateful proposal, one that was to
provide the charter of what was to becomethe Black-diasporic presence in
the Americas. This proposal was thatAfrican slaves, whom he then
believed to have been acquired with a just title,should be brought in
limited numbers as a labor force to replace the Indians.This proposal,
which kick-started what was to be the almost four-centuries-</p>

<blockquote><p>long slave trade out of Africa, had therefore been the result of his
strugglenot to replace &quot;Indians with Africans,&quot; as Liberal historians
who think inbiocentric, classificatory terms would have it---but
rather, within the theo-logical terms in which Las Casas thought and
fought, to replace those whomhe knew from first hand to have been
enslaved and enserfed outside the &quot;justtitle&quot; terms of orthodox
Christian theology with others whom, as he thoughtat the time, had
been acquired within the terms of those &quot;just titles.&quot; Thecited
passage (see Las Casas guide-quote) reveals that Las Casas, when
helater found out that the African slaves had been no less ruthlessly
acquiredoutside the terms of the same just titles than had been the
Indians, was tobitterly repent of his proposal. But by then, the mass
slave trade from Africaacross the Atlantic that would give rise to
today&#39;s transnational BlackDiaspora had taken on a life and
unstoppable dynamic of its own.\
Las Casas had thought and acted in the terms of his Christian
evangel-izing imperative. The Spanish state&#39;s primary imperative,
however, was thatof its territorial expansion, of realizing its
imperial goals of sovereignty overthe new lands. Its jurists had, in
this context, at first attempted to get aroundthe Enemies-of-Christ
obstacle by means of a judicial document called &quot;TheRequisition&quot;
(&quot;Requerimento&quot;). A hybridly theologico-juridical document,written in
Latin, the Requisition was supposed to be read out to groups
ofassembled indigenes by a notary who was to accompany any
slave-raiding,land-expropriating expedition that sailed from the first
settled Caribbeanislands to the mainland. This document was intended
to ensure that theindigenes in question literally heard the Word of
the Christian Gospel, sothat they could then be later classified as
having refused it, and therefore asEnemies-of-Christ. The document
proclaimed to the indigenes that Christ,who was king over the world,
had granted this sovereignty to the pope, whohad in turn granted the
lands of their &quot;barbarous nations&quot; to the king ofSpain, who had sent
the expedition members as his emissaries. The expedi-tionaries had
been sent to give the indigenes the choice of accepting theking of
Spain&#39;s sovereignty over their lands, together with their acceptanceof
Christ&#39;s Word and, with it, of conversion to Christianity. If they
acceptedthe king&#39;s sovereignty together with conversion, they would be
unharmed.Should they refuse (thereby making themselves Christ-Refusers

<p>Enemies-of-Christ), they would be attacked, captured, justly
enslaved---theirlands justly expropriated. If Las Casas was to write
that on reading this doc-ument he did not know whether to laugh or cry,
the reported reply by theCenú peoples on the mainland to one such
expedition opens a transculturalcognitive frontier onto the way in
which, to use Marshall Sahlins&#39; phrase (ifsomewhat inverting its
meaning) &quot;natives think&quot; (Sahlins 1990), and law-likely so within the
terms of their/our order-specific modes of adaptive cog-nition-for,
truth-for.\
Seen from hindsight, what the Cenú are saying (see
Cenú/Greenblattguide-quote) is that, outside the &quot;local cultural&quot; field
of what was thenWestern Europe, and therefore outside the adaptive
truth-for terms of itsmonarchical-Christian genre of being human, the
speech of the Requisitionwas &quot;mad and drunken&quot;: speech that was
meaningless. Since it was only inthe terms of what could seem just and
legitimate to a specific genre of beinghuman that the lands of
non-Christian and non-European peoples couldhave been seen as the pope&#39;s
to give, or the king of Castile&#39;s to take. What isof specific interest
here is not only that it was this initial, large-scale, one-sided
accumulation of lands, wealth, power, and unpaid labor by the Westthat
was to provide the basis for today&#39;s 20/80 wealth and power ratiobetween
the world&#39;s peoples, but also that this primary accumulation hadbeen
effected on the basis of a truth-for, or system of ethno-knowledge,
thatwas no less non-veridical outside the viewpoint of its subjects than
thepremise the Portuguese and Columbus&#39;s voyages had only recently
dis-proved---i.e., the premise that the Earth was nonhomogeneously
dividedinto habitable within God&#39;s Grace and uninhabitable outside it.
Seeing thatwhat we also come upon is the nature of our human cognitive
dilemma, onethat is the very condition of their/our existence as
hybridly nature-culturebeings, the dilemma is how, in Epstein&#39;s terms,
we can be enabled to freeourselves from our subordination to the one
culture, the one descriptivestatement that is the condition of us being
in the mode of being that we are(Epstein 1993).\
That vast dilemma, which is that of our still-unresolved issue of
con-sciousness (McGinn 1999) was one that Las Casas brilliantly touched
uponwhen, referring to the Aztecs&#39; practice of human sacrifice, he
stated that a</p>

<blockquote><p>mistaken (i.e., adaptive) consciousness/conscience impels and obliges
noless than does a true one. However, not only the Cenú Indians, but
theSpaniards themselves had also come to realize the invalid nature of
theirattempt to get around the theological concept of
Enemies-of-Christ. In con-sequence, as Pagden tells us, the Spanish
Crown had, from early on, initiatedthe adoption of new grounds of
legitimacy that were to eventually make theRequisition document
unnecessary. The councils of jurists/theologians thatKing Ferdinand
set up for this purpose had come up with a formula that,adopted from
<em>The Politics</em> of Aristotle, would not only enable the mastertrope of
Nature (seen as God&#39;s agent on Earth) to take the latter&#39;s
authorita-tive place, but would also effect a shift from the
Enemies-of-Christ/Christ-Refusers system of classification to a new
and even more powerfullylegitimating one. It was here that the modern
phenomenon of race, as a new,extrahumanly determined classificatory
principle and mechanism of domi-nation (Quijano 2000), was first
invented, if still in its first religio-secularform. For the
indigenous peoples of the New World, together with the mass-enslaved
peoples of Africa, were now to be reclassified as &quot;irrational&quot;because
&quot;savage&quot; Indians, and as &quot;subrational&quot; Negroes, in the terms of a
for-mula based on an a-Christian premise of a by-nature difference
betweenSpaniards and Indians, and, by extrapolation, between Christian
Europeansand Negroes. This neo-Aristotelian formula had been proposed
by theScottish theologian John Mair.\
A new notion of the world and &quot;idea of order&quot; was being mapped now,no
longer upon the physical cosmos---which beginning with the
fifteenth-century voyages of the Portuguese and Columbus, as well as
with the newastronomy of Copernicus, was eventually to be freed from
having to serve asa projected &quot;space of Otherness,&quot; and as such having
to be known in theadaptive terms needed by human orders to represent
their social structuresas extrahumanly determined ones. Instead, the
projected &quot;space ofOtherness&quot; was now to be mapped on phenotypical and
religio-cultural dif-ferences between human variations and/or
population groups, while thenew idea of order was now to be defined in
terms of degrees of rational per-fection/imperfection, as degrees
ostensibly ordained by the Greco-Christiancultural construct deployed
by Sepúlveda as that of the &quot;law of nature,&quot; &quot;nat-</p>

<p>ural law&quot;: as a &quot;law&quot; that allegedly functioned to order human societies
inthe same way as the newly discovered laws of nature served to regulate
theprocesses of functioning of physical and organic levels of reality.\
It is, therefore, the very humanist strategy of returning to the
paganthought of Greece and Rome for arguments to legitimate the state&#39;s
rise tohegemony, outside the limits of the temporal sovereignty claimed
by thepapacy, that now provides a model for the invention of a by-nature
differ-ence between &quot;natural masters&quot; and &quot;natural slaves,&quot; one able to
replace theChristian/Enemies-of-Christ legitimating difference. For
while Mair doesnot specifically use the term rational, the thesis of a
by-nature difference inrationality (one transumed today into a
by-Evolution &quot;difference&quot; in a sub-stance called I.Q.) was to be central
to the new legitimation of Spain&#39;s rightto sovereignty, as well as of
its settlers&#39; rights both to the land and to thelabor of the Indians.
With, in consequence, the institution of theencomienda system, which
attached groups of Indians to settlers as a neo-serf form of labor,
together with the institution of the slave plantation sys-tem manned by
&quot;Negroes&quot; coming to centrally function so as to produce andreproduce the
socioeconomic and ontological hierarchies of the order as ifindeed they
had been mandated by the ostensibly extrahuman agency of&quot;natural law.&quot;\
For the settlers---as well as for their humanist royal historian and
chap-lain, Ginés de Sepúlveda, who defended their claims (against the
oppositionof the Dominican missionaries and, centrally so, of Las Casas,
who sought toput an end to the encomienda labor system)---the vast
difference thatexisted in religion and culture between the Europeans and
the indigenouspeoples was clear evidence of the latter&#39;s lack of an
ostensibly supraculturalnatural reason. The quite Other form of life and
mode of being human of theindigenous peoples were therefore simply seen
by the Spaniards as the irra-tional Lack of their own. So that even when
confronted, as in the case of theAztecs, with the latter&#39;s complex and
well-organized imperial civilization---one, however, based on the
central institution of large-scale human sacri-fice---Sepúlveda was able
to argue that this practice by itself was clearevidence of the Aztecs&#39;
lack of &quot;natural reason&quot;: of their having thereforebeen determined by
&quot;natural law&quot; to be the &quot;natural slaves&quot; of the Spaniards.</p>

<blockquote><p>In opposition to this thesis, and from the perspective of his own
univer-salist Christianity and evangelizing imperative, Las Casas was
to put for-ward, in his formal dispute with Sepúlveda in 1556, one of
the earliestattempts at a transcultural mode of thinking---one that
was almost hereti-cal to his own Christian religious beliefs. He had
counter-argued that theAztec practice of human sacrifice was a
religious practice that, rather thangiving proof of the Aztecs&#39; lack
of rational reason, proved itself to be an errorof reason itself.
This, given that to the Aztecs human sacrifice, &quot;the sacrificeof
innocents for the good of the commonwealth,&quot; was a practice that was
notonly seen by them to be a legitimate, just, and rational act, but
was also onethat had seemed to them to be a pious and virtuous one. In
effect, an act thathad been seen as being as righteous and virtuous by
the Aztecs in theiradaptive truth-for terms (based on their having
mistaken, from Las Casas&#39;sChristian perspective, their false gods for
the true One) as the Spanish set-tlers&#39; expropriation of the
indigenous peoples&#39; lands and the enserfment oftheir lives/labor would
come to seem just and legitimate to them within theadaptive truth-for
and incipiently secular terms of the new &quot;reasons-of-state&quot;
legitimation now being put forward by Sepúlveda.\
The universally applicable Christianity in the terms of whose schema
ofDivine Election and Damnation Las Casas waged his struggle (terms
that,once he had been informed by his fellow Portuguese missionaries
of theunjust and rapacious methods used by the Portuguese to acquire
Africanslaves, would lead him to confess that his proposal put his own
soul in mor-tal danger), and the identity that he had experienced as
primary---that ofbeing a Christian (an identity that had impelled him
to do &quot;all that one oughtto as a Christian,&quot; which for him had
centrally included making use of thestate as a means of evangelizing
the Indians) were increasingly being madesecondary. This at the same
time as the new identity of the &quot;political sub-ject&quot; (one defined by a
&quot;reasons-of-state ethic,&quot; which instead used theChurch for its own
this-worldly purpose) came to take center stage---thenew identity of
which intellectuals like Sepúlveda were now the bearers. In
consequence, the humanist counter-discourse of the latter,
whichfunctioned in the terms of this new descriptive statement and of
its &quot;rea-sons-of-state ethic,&quot; now became the new &quot;common sense&quot; (as

pre-Darwinian era. It was therefore within the terms of this new
&quot;commonsense&quot;---and in the context of his defense of the settlers&#39;
rights to the landsand enserfed labor of the indigenous peoples, as well
as of the Crown&#39;s rightto wage just war against the latter if they
resisted its sovereignty---thatSepúlveda further elaborated Mair&#39;s
proposed legitimating of neo-Aristotelian by-nature difference, defining
it as one based not only on dif-ferential degrees of rationality, but
also as being human, of humanity.\
Here we see the fatal error attendant on the West&#39;s degodding of its
reli-gious Judeo-Christian descriptive statement of the human at its
clearest.While, as Christians, Westerners could see other peoples as
also having gods(even if, for them, necessarily &quot;false&quot; ones as
contrasted with their &quot;true&quot; andsingle One), as subjects defined by the
identity Man, this could no longer bethe case. Seeing that once its
&quot;descriptive statement&quot; had been instituted asthe only, universally
applicable mode of being human, they would remainunable, from then on
until today, of (to paraphrase Lyotard) conceiving anOther to what they
call human (Lyotard 1990). And where the matrixChristian conception of
the human, which not only knew itself to be creed-specific, but which
had also been one carried by a Church that had beenengaged for hundreds
of years in Europe itself in the Christianizing conver-sion of pagan
peoples, had compelled its missionaries to engage in tran-screedal,
transcultural modes of cognition, even where transforming thepagan gods
into the satanic figure of their Christian Devil---for the human-ists&#39;
&quot;Man,&quot; overrepresented as the supracultural, super-creedal human
itself,this was not possible. Hence the logic by which, for the humanist
Sepúlveda,the religious practices of the Aztecs were, so to speak,
&quot;crimes againsthumanity,&quot; breaches of the ostensible universally
applicable &quot;natural law,&quot;---a law that imposed a by-nature divide
between &quot;civilized&quot; peoples (as truegeneric humans who adhered to its
Greco-European cultural construct) andthose, like the indigenous peoples
of the Americas and the Caribbean, whodid not. As such, the New World
peoples had to be seen and constructed,increasingly by all Europeans, in
neo-Sepúlvedan terms as forms of HumanOtherness, if to varying degrees,
to a now secularizing West&#39;s own. And whilea Las Casas, in the context
of his struggle against both Mair&#39;s and Sepúlveda&#39;s</p>

subhuman---that further, their(in his terms) deliberate &quot;slandering&quot;
of an entire population, of a &quot;large partof God&#39;s Creation&quot; had the
directly instrumental purpose of subordinatingthe peoples whom they

articulating its master code of sym-bolic life and death, had been

organizing principle and master code. And as one whosefoundational
premise of nonhomogeneity, which was now to be mappedonto a projected,
ostensibly divinely created difference of substance betweenrational
humans and irrational animals, would also come to be mapped atanother
&quot;space of Otherness&quot; level. This level was that of a projected Chainof
Being comprised of differential/hierarchical degrees of rationality
(andthereby, as shown in the quote from Sepúlveda, of humanity)
between dif-ferent populations, their religions, cultures, forms of
life; in other words,their modes of being human. And while the West
placed itself at the apex,incorporating the rest (the majority of whom
it would come to dominate interms of their differential degrees of

Crown like the Spaniards, if still secondary &quot;native&quot;ones) at the same
time as the &quot;Negroes&quot; would continue to constitute theonly outrightly
enslaved labor force, and this fact was a partial cause of
thisdifferential, there was an additional major and powerful factor.
This factorwas that of the role that the black skin and somatotype of
peoples of Africanhereditary descent had been made to play, for
centuries, in the elaborationof monotheistic Christianity, as well as in
all three monotheisms, all of whichhad been religions instituted by
population groups who were white-skinned,or at least, not black-skinned.
With the result that the intellectuals of thesegroups, in developing the
symbolic systems of their monotheistic creeds,had come to define these
symbols in the terms of their own somatotypenorm, in the same way as the
Bantu-Congolese had done in developing theirpolytheistic own. An account
of the early seventeenth-century kingdom ofthe Congo, written by a
Spanish Capuchin missionary priest (Father Antoniode Teruel), reveals
the above parallel, thereby providing us with a transgenre-of-the-human,
transcultural perspective.\
The indigenous peoples of the Congo,&quot; Teruel wrote, &quot;are all black
incolor, some more so, some less so. Many are to be seen who are the
color ofchestnut and some tend to be more olive-colored. But the one who
is of the</p>

areborn somewhat light-skinned, but as they grow older they become
darkerand darker. This occurs because their mothers make use of the
artifice of anointment . . . with which they anoint their infants,
exposing them once theyhave been anointed, to the rays of the sun,
then leaving them there for longperiods, and repeating this action
over and over . . .&quot; (Teruel 1663‒64; empha-sis added)</p>
<p>Given the fact that a black skin is so highly regarded among them, we</p>
<p>Europeans appear ugly in their eyes. As a result, children in those
areas,</p>
<p>where a white has never been seen before, would become terrified,
fleeing in</p>
<p>horror from us, no less than our children here are terrified by the
sight of a</p>
<p>black also fleeing in horror from them. But they do not want us to
call them</p>
<p>negroes (negros) but Blacks (Prietos); amongst them only slaves are

<p>negroes and thus amongst them it is the same things to say negro as to
say</p>
<p>slave&quot; (Teruel (1663‒1664) Ms. 3533:3574).</p>
<p>Unlike the Bantu-Congolese ethno-specific conception, however,
themonotheists had projected their respective creeds as universally
applicableones, defining their God(s) and symbol systems as the only
&quot;true&quot; ones. Thiswas to be even more the case with respect to
Christianity from the time ofthe Crusades onwards. With the result
that, as the historian Fernández-Armesto noted in his description of
the &quot;mental horizons&quot; of ChristianEuropeans at the time of their
fourteenth-century expansion into theMediterranean, followed by their
expansions into the Atlantic, in the termsof those &quot;horizons,&quot; Black
Africans had been already classified (and for cen-turies before the
Portuguese landing on the shores of Senegal in 1444) in acategory &quot;not
far removed from the apes, as man made degenerate by sin.&quot;And while
the roots of this projection had come from a biblical traditioncommon
to all three monotheisms---that is, &quot;that the sons of Ham werecursed
with blackness, as well as being condemned to slavery&quot;---in Europe,it
had come to be elaborated in terms that were specific to Christianity.
Inthis elaboration, the &quot;diabolical color,&quot; black, had become the
preferred colorfor the depiction of &quot;demons&quot; and the signification of

<p>actualization, therefore, of Judeo-Christianity&#39;s behavior-programming
pos-tulate of &quot;significant ill&quot; to its limit degree. So that as a
result, in addition totheir being co-classified with apes, who
&quot;iconographically . . . signified sin,&quot;Black Africans were generally
thought in &quot;medieval ape lore,&quot; a precursor tothe theory of Evolution,
to be &quot;degenerate&quot; descendants of &quot;true man&quot;(Fernández-Armesto 1987).
Because all of these traditions reinforced eachother, the &quot;descendants

at the popular level, once the Enemies-of-Christjustificatory category
had been discarded as legitimation of the massenslavements of Africans
(at the official level of Church doctrine, one of thejustifications was
also that the latter&#39;s physical enslavement was a means ofsaving their
souls), would be inextricably linked to Judeo-Christianity&#39;s
&quot;for-mulations of a general order of existence,&quot; to its descriptive
statement ofwhat it was to be a Christian---to be, therefore, in their
own conception, theonly possible and universally applicable mode of
being human, yet as a modewhich nonconsciously carried over, as the
referent of &quot;normalcy,&quot; their ownsomatotype norm in the same way as

<blockquote><p>demned category of peoples enslaved to Original Sin, and the Elect
categoryof those redeemed from this sin has now been recast in the
terms of the &quot;by-nature difference&quot; of rationality, the &quot;ape&quot; figure
will be deployed in the newterms of a secularizing iconography as the
marker of a naturally determinedzero degree of irrationality. So that,
as the earlier ontological distinctionbetween the Elect-Redeemed and
the Condemned (a distinction that hadbeen actualized by the relation
between the category of the celibate clergyand that of the
non-celibate laity) came to be replaced by the new distinc-tion made
between those determined by nature to be the possessors of rea-son,
and those predestined by it to remain enslaved to a lack of such
reason,this distinction will be actualized in a new relation. This was
the relation, inthe Americas and the Caribbean, between the European
settlers classified asby nature a people of reason (<em>gente de razón</em>)
and the non-European popu-lation groups &quot;Indians&quot; and &quot;Negroes,&quot;
classified as &quot;brute peoples without&quot;reason&quot; who were no less
naturally determined to be so. It is here, therefore,that the figure
of the Negro was now to be transferred, like that of the ape,from the
earlier iconography of sin and its postulate of &quot;significant ill&quot; to
thenew iconography of irrationality, to its new postulate of
&quot;significant ill.&quot; As aresult, where before the &quot;Negro&quot; had been
projected, within the terms of theJudeo-Christian imaginary, as the
&quot;figure&quot; of the human made degenerate bysin, and therefore
supernaturally determined (through the mediation ofNoah&#39;s curse laid
upon the descendants of Ham) to be the nearest of all peo-ples to the
ape, now he/she will be projected as the by-nature determined(i.e.,
caused) missing link between true (because rational) humans and
theirrational figure of the ape. This at the same time as inside
Europe, theincreasingly interned figure of the Mad would itself come
to function, withinthe terms of the same iconography, as the signifier
of the &quot;significant ill&quot; ofa threatened enslavement to irrationality
in the reoccupied place of themedieval Leper, whose figure, in a
parallel way to that of the &quot;Negro,&quot; hadserved as the
intra--Christian-European signifier of the then &quot;significant ill&quot;of
enslavement to Original Sin.\
This alerts us to the dialectic at work in the epochal shift effected
by theWest from the explanatory model of supernatural causation to
that of natu-ral causation. That is, to the fact that it was the same

<p>legitimated the large-scale expropriation and mass enslavement of two
peo-ples on the grounds of a naturally determined difference of rational
sub-stance between them and their expropriators and slave masters that
had, atthe same time, made possible the rise and development of the
physical sci-ences as a new order of human cognition. This meant that
the same modelthat was to initiate the centuries-long degradation of two
human groups forthe benefit of another such group was to also set in
motion the process thatwould emancipate the &quot;objective set of facts&quot; of
the physical level of realityfrom having to be known in the adaptive
truth-for terms in which it had beenhitherto known by all human
population groups. This had been so known, inexactly the same way as
&quot;Indians&quot; and &quot;Negroes&quot; were now going to be&quot;known&quot; by Europeans, as an
indispensable function of the mechanisms bymeans of which, as Godelier
points out, all human groups have been enabledto make the fact that it
is they/we who are the authors and agents of our ownorders opaque to
themselves/ourselves. Since they are mechanisms that func-tion to
project their/our authorship onto Imaginary supernatural Beings, aswell
as to represent the latter as being as much the creators of the
physicalcosmos onto which each order mapped its structuring principles,
descriptivestatement of the human, and correlated moral laws as they are
of the sub-jects, who ostensibly merely mirror these laws in the
organization of their/ourown social hierarchies, divisions of labor, and
role allocations.\
Hence the logic by which, if the Copernican Revolution was to be
onlymade possible by the West&#39;s invention of Man outside the terms of
the ortho-dox, &quot;sinful by nature&quot; descriptive statement and theocentric
conception ofthe human, Christian, this was to be only fully effected by
the parallel inven-tion/instituting of the new categories that were to
serve as the physical ref-erents of Man&#39;s Human Other. With the result
that the same explanatorymodel that legitimated the expropriation and
internment of the Indians, themass enslavement of the Negroes, and the
internment of the Mad---all osten-sibly as living proof of their
naturally determined enslavement to irrational-ity---will also underlie
the cognitively emancipatory shift from theexplanatory model of
supernatural causation to that of natural causation,which made the
natural sciences possible. The shift, therefore, from theexplanatory
principle of Divine Providence and/or retribution, as well as</p>

<blockquote><p>from that of witchcraft and sorcery, to that of the new principle of
laws ofnature, of events happening cursus solitus naturae (in the
accustomed orordinary course of nature) as the explanatory model that
underlay the sci-entific revolution, both with respect to the physical
sciences and, if moreslowly so, to the rise of modern medicine.\
However, at the same time as the West initiated the process by means
ofwhich the projection of extrahuman causation could no longer be
mapped,in good faith, on the physical levels of reality, it would also
begin, in the wakeof its reinventing of its descriptive statement as
that of Man in its first form,to identify as its Imaginary extrahuman
Being the figure of &quot;Nature,&quot; nowrepresented as the authoritative
agent on earth of a God who, having createdit, has now begun to recede
into the distance. So that as the earlierSpirit/Flesh master code was
being relegated to a secondary and increas-ingly privatized space, the
new rational/irrational master code, which wasto be the structuring of
the rearranged hierarchies of the now centralizedpolitical order of
the modern state, was being projected upon another &quot;spaceof
Otherness.&quot; This was that of the projected hierarchy of a graduated
table,or Chain of all forms of sentient life, from those classified as
the lowest tothose as the highest. It is, therefore, as the new
rational/irrational line(drawn between the fundamental ontological
distinction of a representednonhomogeneity between divinely
created-to-be-rational humans, on theone hand, and divinely
created-to-be irrational animals, on the other) comesto be actualized
in the institutionalized differences between European set-tlers and
Indians/Negroes, that the figure of the Negro as the projected
miss-ing link between the two sides of the rational/irrational divide
will inevitablycome to be represented in the first &quot;scientific&quot;
taxonomy of human popula-tions, that of Linnaeus, as the population
that, in contrast to the European(which is governed by laws), is
governed by caprice (Linnaeus 1735). So irra-tional that it will have
to be governed by others.\
In consequence, and as Poliakov argues in <em>The Aryan Myth</em> (1974), it
isthe population group classified as &quot;Negro&quot; by the West who would be
madeto pay the most total psycho-existential price for the West&#39;s
epochal degod-ding of both its matrix Judeo-Christian identity and the
latter&#39;s projection ofOtherness. Since, if that process called for the

<p>(Bloom 1983) of the monotheistic macro-stereotype of all Black peoples
asdescendants of Noah&#39;s son Ham (whom he had cursed, condemning
hisdescendants to be the servants to the descendants of those of his two
othersons, Japhet and Shem), and its reattachment to the new concept of
the sub-rational Negro, condemned this time by the malediction of Nature
ratherthan by Noah, this was because, in both cases, that stereotype had
becomeindispensable to the mechanisms by which the Judeo-Christian
Westenacted its descriptive statement of the human---firstly as
Christian, then asits first hybridly religio-secular variant, Man.\
This in the same way in which it would remain indispensable to
theenacting of the descriptive statement of the now purely secular
because bio-centric Darwinian variant of Man: one in which the Human
Other maledic-tion or curse, one shared with all the now colonized
nonwhite peoplesclassified as &quot;natives&quot; (but as their extreme nigger
form) would be no longerthat of Noah or Nature, but of Evolution and
Natural Selection. So that what-ever the terms of derogatory clichés of
which both the native and the &quot;Negro&quot;are the butt, what is clear is that
its obsessive &quot;name of what is evil&quot; stereo-typing functions as an
indispensable part of the Godelier-type mechanismby which the subjects
of the West (including those subjects like ourselveswhom it has
&quot;westernized&quot; and &quot;modernized&quot;) are enabled to make opaqueto
themselves/ourselves (according to the same nature-culture laws bywhich
the subjects of all other human orders have done and do the same)the
empirical fact of our ongoing production and reproduction of our
order,of its genre of being human, its mode of consciousness or mind,
and there-fore of the latter&#39;s adaptive truth-for. We are, as
intellectuals, the agents ofits formal elaboration.\
The first form of the secularizing, &quot;name of what is evil,&quot; stereotyped
roleof the &quot;Negro&quot; was, however, different from the form it now takes.
Poliakovlinks that first form, and the conceptual imaginative terms it
would take, toa shift in the role played by that other major Other
figure to the Judeo-Christian identity, the Jew. This shift began with
the rise of the modern statein Spain, together with the centralizing of
its order, from 1492 onwards. Inthat year, all Jews who adhered to their
religion of Judaism were expelled,while shortly after, the conquered
Islamic Moors of southern Spain began to</p>

<blockquote><p>be forcibly converted to Christianity---both as effects of the goal of
&quot;religiousunification&quot; that was to be the basis of the monarchical
order of Spain. Inconsequence, Poliakov points out---because a great
number of Jews hadaccepted conversion to Christianity, rather than
being expelled---the impo-sition of a single orthodox faith, that of
Christianity, under the aegis of theInquisition as an agent of the new
state had given rise to the problem of theconversos or converts,
either Moriscos (Muslim converts) or Marranos(Jewish converts). It
was, therefore, in the context of the shift from being aprimarily
religious subject, for whom the &quot;name of what is evil&quot; was/is thatof a
common enslavement by all mankind to Original Sin, to that of being
apolitical subject of a state (yet unified on the basis of its
Christian creed)that the Other to the norm of this subject was to be
the category of the con-versos, both Marranos and Moriscos. A specific
reprobation was thereforenow placed on these two categories: that of
their impurity or uncleanness ofblood, and also of their faith,
because descended from ancestors who hadpracticed the Jewish and the
Islamic creeds.\
If, as Harold Bloom notes, cultural fields are kept in being by
transump-tive chains (Bloom 1982), it was to be the trope of &quot;purity
of blood,&quot; togetherwith that of its threatening &quot;stain&quot; (itself a
&quot;re-troped&quot; form of the matrixnegative construct of the &quot;taint&quot; of
Original Sin) that, once re-troped as&quot;racial purity,&quot; would come to be
attached to peoples of Black African hered-itary descent. With the
result that if the latter would (together with a rangeof other
nonwhite &quot;natives&quot;) come to reoccupy the now purely secular placethat
had been earlier occupied by the Marrano and Morisco, the
deep-seatedbelief in the pollution carried by their &quot;negro blood&quot;
would lead to the themeof miscegenation coming to reoccupy the earlier
foundational place that theincest had taken in all other human orders
(Fox 1983). This at the same timeas all members of this population
were now to be constructed, discursivelyand institutionally, as the
bottom marker---not now merely on a local scale,such as that of the
&quot;clean&quot; Spanish-Christian scale of being, but instead ofwhat was to
become, from Sepúlveda onwards, that of a projected univer-sally human
scale of being. With this being so, whether in the terms of
theEnlightenment&#39;s &quot;Nature,&quot; or even more totally so in terms of the
Darwinianparadigm of Evolution.</p>

<p>What Poliakov reveals here, therefore, is the nonarbitrary and
systemicnature of the way in which the range of negatively marked tropes
attached tothe &quot;figure&quot; of the &quot;Negro&quot; were/are only the contemporary
culmination of aprocess by means of which, beginning early on in the
sixteenth century, a pro-jected taxonomy of human population groups had
begun to be put in place---one in which the &quot;Negro&quot; had to be,
imperatively, at the bottom. Beginningwith Peter Martyr&#39;s 1516
definition of Indians as &quot;white,&quot; as contrasted with&quot;black&quot; Ethiopians,
this placing was carried over in the first attempt at
&quot;racialclassification&quot; by François Bernier in 1684, which also
assimilated the Indiansto the white race now projected as the normal
race. While the parallel sys-temic construction of the Black as the
&quot;abnormal&quot; race can be seen in thegeneralization of the
positive/negative value meanings (common to allEuropean languages) as
between mestizo (white/Indian) and mulatto(white/Black). What Poliakov
further demonstrates is that, in the same wayas the systemic
construction of Moriscos and Marranos was an indispensa-ble function of
the inscripting and instituting of the norm subject of theSpanish
religio-political monarchical state as a &quot;clean&quot; and therefore
rationalsubject (rather than, as before, a subject seeking to be
spiritually redeemed),so it is to be with respect to the role of the
Black Other in the constructionof Europeans as racially &quot;pure,&quot; secular
subjects. In that, beginning with theWest&#39;s expansion in the fifteenth
century, it would be the Black populationgroup whose discursive and
institutional degradation as the new ne plusultra marker of barely human
status (whether in the terms of Man1 or ofMan2) was to be an
indispensable function of the enacting of the descriptivestatements by
means of which the West was to effect its epochal
de-super-naturalization of its matrix mode of being human. As
redescriptions, that is,by means of which it would open the frontier
onto natural-scientific knowl-edge, both of the physical and (after
Darwin) of the biological levels of real-ity, at the same time as these
redescriptions were to lead directly to thepresent &quot;Two Cultures&quot; divide
of our contemporary order of knowledge.\
So that if Darwin&#39;s redescription of the human in now purely
secularterms, and his deconstruction of the rational/irrational master
codemapped on to a projected Chain of Being of all forms of sentient
life, was tomake possible the rise and development of the biological
sciences, on the</p>

there; that is, outside the view-point of ethnoclass Man---of its

this point, if in somewhat different terms, when he wrote in 1986on
the great impact of the sociopolitical upheavals of the late fifties
and six-ties, particularly decolonization and liberation movements.
And althoughmost of the new theoretical departures, he would add, were

tobe that of feminist studies was due to a fundamental fact. This was
that ofthe way in which while before the sixties, the issues with
which women wereconcerned had been addressed only in the context of
the Woman&#39;s Questionof the Marxist paradigm (as, at that time, the
only paradigm concerned withthe relation between knowledge and human
emancipation), in the wake ofthe sixties, women activists had ceased
their earlier &quot;echoing&quot; of Marxistthought and had redefined the
Woman&#39;s Question into an issue that was spe-cific to their own
concerns, rather than as merely being, as before, a subsetof what
might be called the Labor Issue. Renaming themselves feminists,they
had redescribed their issue as that of gender and sexism, thereby
tar-geting the deconstruction of the social phenomenon of patriarchy
as theirgoal, rather than the mode-of-economic-production target of
the MarxianLabor issue. This has not been the case, however, with the
issues that beforethe sixties had been known as the Colonial Question,
the &quot;Native&quot; (i.e. non-white) and the Negro Question---all of which
had been, like the Woman&#39;sQuestion, subsets of the Marxian Labor
issue. This in spite of the fact thatat the empirical level, it was
the multiple movements related to these ques-tions that had most
forcibly erupted in concrete political and social strug-gles all over
the globe, as well as internally in the United States.</p>

<p>The Argument proposes, on the basis of the first part of its title, that
allof these Questions, ones that in the wake of the attaining of
political inde-pendence by the former colonies or of the ending of
segregation in theUnited States would come to be labeled instead as the
Third-World and&quot;Minority&quot; Questions, now need to be redescribed in the
terms of an issuethat is specific to them---yet one that has hitherto
had no name, seeing thatit cannot exist as an &quot;object of knowledge&quot;
within the terms of our presentorder of knowledge any more than, as
Foucault points out, biological lifecould have existed as an object of
knowledge in the classical (and in myterms, the pre-bourgeois) episteme.
This issue is that of the genre of thehuman, the issue whose target of
abolition is the ongoing collective produc-tion of our present
ethnoclass mode of being human, Man: above all, itsoverrepresentation of
its well-being as that of the human species as a whole,rather than as it
is veridically: that of the Western and westernized (or con-versely)
global middle classes.\
The paradox with which we are confronted here is the following: that
inthe wake of the intellectual revolution of the Renaissance, as carried
out inlarge part by the lay humanists of the Renaissance on the basis of
their reval-orized redescription of the human as the rational, political
subject, Man---on the basis, as Jacob Pandian points out, of their
parallel invention of Man&#39;sHuman Others---Western intellectuals were to
gradually emancipate knowl-edge of the physical cosmos from having to be
known in the adaptive, order-maintaining terms in which it had hitherto
been known by means of the riseand development of the physical sciences.
This meant that increasingly, andfor all human groups, the physical
cosmos could no longer come to be validlyused for such projections.
Instead, the West&#39;s new master code ofrational/irrational nature was now
to be mapped onto a projected Chain ofBeing of organic forms of life,
organized about a line drawn between, on theone hand, divinely
created-to-be-rational humans, and on the other, no lessdivinely
created-to-be-irrational animals; that is, on what was still
adaptivelyknown through the classical discipline of &quot;natural history&quot; as
a still super-naturally determined and created &quot;objective set of facts.&quot;
This &quot;space ofOtherness&quot; line of nonhomogeneity had then functioned to
validate thesocio-ontological line now drawn between rational, political
Man (Prospero,</p>

cate-gories of Caliban [i.e., the subordinated Indians and the
enslaved Negroes]),in exactly the same way as, before Copernicus, the
&quot;space of Otherness&quot; pro-jection of a nonhomogeneity of substance
between the perfection of thecelestial realm and the degradation of
the terrestrial had reciprocally bol-stered and validated the
Spirit/Flesh code as enacted in the ontologicalvalue difference
between clergy and laity within the terms of Judeo-Christianity&#39;s
matrix formulation of a &quot;general order of existence.&quot; In thesame way,
therefore, as in the order of knowledge of pre-Newtonian Europe,all
knowledge of the astronomy of the universe had had, however
technicallysophisticated and whatever its predictive power, to remain
couched inethno-astronomical terms, so all pre-Darwinian knowledge of
organic lifehad had to be conceptualized in the terms of a (so to
speak) proto- or ethno-biology.\
The biological sciences were therefore to come into existence only in
thewake of the second act of redescription effected during the
nineteenth cen-tury by Liberal humanist intellectuals---as a
redescription by means ofwhich the still hybridly religio-secular
political subject conception of thehuman, Man (as embodied in
Prospero) was redefined as optimally eco-nomic Man, at the same time
as this Man was redefined by Darwin as apurely biological being whose
origin, like that of all other species, was sitedin Evolution, with
the human therefore existing in a line of pure continuitywith all
other organic forms of life. A mutation had thereby occurred, in
thatDarwin, by means of his deconstruction of the Chain of Being that
had beenearlier mapped onto the rational human/irrational animals
line, had begunthe emancipation of the human knowledge of the purely
biological level ofreality from having to be known in genre-specific
adaptive terms, therebygiving rise to the biological sciences and to
its contemporary, dazzling tri-umphs---as, for example, the cracking
of the DNA code, the Human GenomeProject, together with the utopian
cum dystopian promises and possibilitiesof biotechnology.\
It can be seen in hindsight that the &quot;space of Otherness&quot; which had
beenprojected both upon the heavens as well as upon organic life, had
been acentral function of the Godelier-type mechanisms by means of

inthat the respective codes that had been mapped upon them (i.e., that
ofRedeemed Spirit/Fallen Flesh, then that of rational nature [redeemed
fromirrationality] and irrational nature [enslaved to irrationality])
had bothplayed a central analogical status-ordering and thereby
system-maintainingrole for their respective social systems: firstly,
that of Latin-Christian Europe,followed by that of the monarchical
(whether absolute or constitutionallylimited) order of the landed-gentry
West. Analogical in the sense that it wastheir &quot;space of Otherness&quot;
projection that had induced the subjects of bothof these orders to both
know and experience their societies&#39; respective roleallocation, social
hierarchies, divisions of labor, and ratio-proportional dis-tribution of
their goods and their bads as being supernaturally preor-dained---as, in
their respective ethno-knowledges, both the projecteddifference of
ontological substance between heaven and earth (Spirit/Flesh)in the
first case, and in the second, that between rational humans and
irra-tional animals, had been divinely created to be. With the
status-orderingprinciples generated from their respective codes---one
based on ostensiblydifferential degrees of enslavement to sin/redemption
from sin, the other onostensibly differential degrees of rational
nature/enslavement to irrationalnature---thereby inducing the subjects
of these orders to experience theirown placement in the structuring
hierarchies of the order as having beenextrahumanly (in these two cases
supernaturally) designed and/or deter-mined, rather than as veridically
or systemically produced by our collectivehuman agency.\
The Argument proposes that the new master code of the bourgeoisieand of
its ethnoclass conception of the human---that is, the code of selectedby
Evolution/dysselected by Evolution---was now to be mapped andanchored on
the only available &quot;objective set of facts&quot; that remained. Thiswas the
set of environmentally, climatically determined phenotypical
dif-ferences between human hereditary variations as these had developed
inthe wake of the human diaspora both across and out of the continent
ofAfrica; that is, as a set of (so to speak) totemic differences, which
were nowharnessed to the task of projecting the Color Line drawn
institutionally anddiscursively between whites/nonwhites---and at its
most extreme between</p>

that somehumans can be dysselected by Evolution)---as the new
extrahuman line, orprojection of genetic nonhomogeneity that would now
be made to function,analogically, as the status-ordering principle
based upon ostensibly differ-ential degrees of evolutionary

as the new &quot;space of Otherness&quot; principle ofnonhomogeneity, made to
reoccupy the earlier places of the motion-filledheavens/non-moving

questionof the who and what we are.\
It is in this context that the Negro, the Native, the Colonial
Questions,and postcolonially the &quot;Underdeveloped&quot; or Third/Fourth-Worlds
Questioncan be clearly seen to be the issue, not of our present mode of
economic pro-duction, but rather of the ongoing production and
reproduction of thisanswer---that is, our present biocentric ethnoclass
genre of the human, ofwhich our present techno-industrial, capitalist
mode of production is anindispensable and irreplaceable, but only a
proximate function. With thisgenre of the human being one in the terms
of whose dually biogenetic andeconomic notions of freedom both the
peoples of African hereditary descentand the peoples who comprise the
damned archipelagoes of the Poor, thejobless the homeless, the
&quot;underdeveloped&quot; must lawlikely be sacrificed as afunction of our
continuing to project our collective authorship of our con-temporary
order onto the imagined agency of Evolution and NaturalSelection and, by
extrapolation, onto the &quot;Invisible Hand&quot; of the &quot;FreeMarket&quot; (both being
cultural and class-specific constructs).\
The challenge to be confronted at this conjuncture is this: While
fromthe Renaissance onwards, Western intellectuals have, by means of the
devel-opment of the natural sciences, enabled us to obtain nonadaptive
knowl-edge of our nonhuman levels of reality, we have hitherto had no
such parallelknowledge with respect to ourselves and the nature-culture
laws that gov-ern our modes of being, of behaving, of mind, or of
minding. The buck forsuch knowledge (one able to open up a new frontier
of nonadaptive humanself-cognition, and therefore the possibility of our
nonheteronomously andnow consciously ordered/motivated behaviors, beyond
the ethnoclass limitsof our contemporary ones) stops with us. While the
prescriptive guidelinesof how we are to set about this challenge lie in
the paradox of the newDarwinian descriptive statement of the human: Man
in its second, purelysecular, biocentric, and overrepresented modality
of being human. Whatthen had been the contradiction at the heart of the
Darwinian Revolution,at the core of its paradigm of Evolution that was
to give rise to, on the onehand, the continuing dazzling successes of
the biological sciences and, onthe other, not only to the obsessive
ethno-biological beliefs in the genetic</p>

Although Foucault, in his analysis of the processes by means of
whichthe classical episteme was replaced by our own, had proposed that
theseepistemes be seen as being discontinuous with each other, what he
oversawwas that such a discontinuity, like the earlier discontinuity
that had beeneffected by the classical episteme itself, was taking
place in the terms of acontinuous cultural field, one instituted by
the matrix Judeo-Christian for-mulation of a general order of
existence. That, therefore, these shifts in epis-temes were not only
shifts with respect to each episteme&#39;s specific order
ofknowledge/truth, but were also shifts in what can now be identified
as the&quot;politics of being&quot;; that is, as a politics that is everywhere
fought over whatis to be the descriptive statement, the governing
sociogenic principle, insti-tuting of each genre of the human. With
the result that as Christian becomesMan1 (as political subject), then
as Man1 becomes Man2 (as a bio-economicsubject), from the end of the
eighteenth century onwards, each of these newdescriptive statements
will nevertheless remain inscribed within the frame-work of a specific
secularizing reformulation of that matrix Judeo-ChristianGrand
Narrative. With this coming to mean that, in both cases, their
epis-temes will be, like their respective genres of being human, both
discontinu-ous and continuous.\
This was the fact that Jacob Pandian brought to our attention when
henoted that the Untrue Christian Self as the Other to the True
Christian Selfof the Judeo-Christian conception was to be
re-inscripted, from the six-teenth century onwards, as the new Untrue
Human Others to the &quot;true&quot;human that is Man, in its two forms. Firstly
as subrational Indian, NegroOthers to Man1, then, secondly, as native

it should, whilenow effected in purely biologized terms, still carry
over, if in new post-six-ties terms, the &quot;undeserving&quot; &quot;name of what is

been placed by medievalChristianity on the Negroid physiognomy (Gans
1999). With the conse-quence that because now made to embody and
actualize the example of thehuman, not now as fallen to the status of
the ape, but rather as barely evolvedfrom it (and, as such, an
undeserving race because dysselected-by-Evolutionwithin the logic of the
Darwinian paradigm), it was now not only the peo-ples of the Black
ex-slave Diaspora, but all the peoples of Black Africa whowould be also
compelled to confront the inescapable fact (one attested to bythe
infamous 41-bullet shooting death of Amadou Diallo) that, as put
suc-cinctly by Frantz Fanon, &quot;wherever he[/she] goes in the world, the
Negroremains a Negro&quot; (Fanon 1967)---and, as such, made to reoccupy the
signi-fying place of medieval/Latin-Christian Europe&#39;s fallen, degraded,
andthereby nonmoving Earth.\
The Argument here redefines Marx&#39;s class struggle in the terms of a
&quot;pol-itics of being&quot;: that is, one waged over what is to be the
descriptive state-ment of the human, about whose master code of symbolic
life and deatheach human order organizes itself. It then proposes that
it was preciselybecause of the above political dynamic---which
underpinned the DarwinianRevolution, making it possible---that it was
also compelled to function as ahalf-scientific, half-mythic theory of
origins, at least as it had to do with thehuman. Since it was to be in
the context of the political struggle for hege-mony that was being waged
by a then increasingly wealthy but non-landedbourgeoisie against the
established ruling elite of the landed gentry elite thatDarwin would be
impelled to put forward a new theory with respect to theorigin of all
species, including the human species (one able to move outsidethe terms
of the &quot;Argument from Divine Design&quot;), that had functioned tolegitimate
both the ruling status of the landed gentry and the order of knowl-edge
of the classical episteme, and that had provided the mode of
adaptivetruth-for indispensable to the legitimation of the ruling
gentry&#39;s hegemony.</p>

thatDarwin was to put forward his brilliantly innovative new paradigm
thatwould lead to the rise and development of the biological sciences,
at thesame time as it would also elaborate a new origin narrative in
place ofGenesis (Isaacs 1983).\
Blumenberg reveals the central role that will be played in this
reformu-lation by the clergyman-economist Thomas Malthus (Blumenberg
1983).This is the new form of the &quot;absence of order&quot; that Malthus will
elaborate inhis 1798 <em>Essay on the Principle of Population</em>. For
Malthus, it is the&quot;autonomous lawfulness of population growth,&quot;
projected as a &quot;universal lawof life,&quot; which predetermines a new
modality of the &quot;absence of order&quot;: thistime, the ostensibly
fundamental contradiction posed by the fact that men&#39;sincrease in
numbers is a geometric progression, whereas the increase in
thequantity of food can only be an arithmetical progression. With the
resultthat given the widening gap between the two progressions, the
law of self-regulation that follows logically calls for the state&#39;s
noninterference with theostensibly extrahuman regulatory effect of the
supposed &quot;law of nature&quot;---alaw that also calls for the category of
the Poor to be left by themselves,unaided by any measures taken by the
state, in order that its members canbe weeded out by the &quot;iron laws&quot;
of nature. What Malthus puts in place,therefore, is the second
transumed reformulation of the matrix Judeo-Christian formulation.
Enslavement here is no longer to Original Sin, or toone&#39;s irrational
nature---with, in the case of the latter, the threat or &quot;signifi-cant
ill&quot; of the political state falling into the chaos and
nonpredictability ofa state-of-nature. Rather, enslavement is now to
the threat of Malthusianoverpopulation, to its concomitant &quot;ill&quot; of
Natural Scarcity whose imperative&quot;plan of salvation&quot; would now be
postulated in economic terms as that ofkeeping this at bay---of
material, in the place of the matrix spiritual,Redemption.\
The above reformulations were all part of the then intellectuals&#39;
struggleto redescribe both the human, and its human activity, outside
the terms ofthe description of the human on whose basis the owners of
landed wealthhad based their hegemony. What is usually overlooked,
however, is that theirredescription will be one that carried in its
turn a new descriptive statement</p>

<p>able to legitimate the rise to hegemony of the non-landed,
capital-owningbourgeoisie as the new ruling elite. While it will be in
the lineaments of thenew criteria defining of Man2, in the terms of this
new descriptive statement,that the lineaments of its negative Human
Others are also already outlined.Seeing that if at one level Man2 is now
defined as a jobholding Breadwinner,and even more optimally, as a
successful &quot;masterer of Natural Scarcity&quot;(Investor, or capital
accumulator), what might be called the archipelago ofits modes of Human
Otherness can no longer be defined in the terms of theinterned Mad, the
interned &quot;Indian,&quot; the enslaved &quot;Negro&quot; in which it hadbeen earlier
defined. Instead, the new descriptive statement of the humanwill call
for its archipelago of Human Otherness to be peopled by a new cat-egory,
one now comprised of the jobless, the homeless, the Poor, the
sys-temically made jobless and criminalized---of the
&quot;underdeveloped&quot;---all asthe category of the economically damnés (Fanon
1963), rather than, asbefore, of the politically condemned. With the
result that if inside Europe, itwill be the Poor who will be made to
reoccupy the earlier proscribed internedplaces of the Leper and the Mad,
in the Euro-Americas, it is the freed Negro,together with the Indians
interned in reservations, or as peons on hacien-das, who will now be
interned in the new institution of Poverty/Joblessness.That is, in an
institution now made to actualize the idea of the humanovercome by
Natural Scarcity, and therefore in the process of being sweptaway by
Malthus&#39;s &quot;iron laws of nature,&quot; because unable, as the regular
job-holding Breadwinners and Investors are so clearly able to do, to
master the&quot;ill&quot; of this scarcity. This at the same time, as Fanon shows
in <em>The Wretchedof the Earth</em>, as the &quot;native&quot; rural agro-proletariat
interned in colonial insti-tutions would be made to actualize the
category most totally condemned topoverty and joblessness, ostensibly
because of the represented bio-evolu-tionarily determined incapacity of
its members to do otherwise. Since, likethe medieval Leper, whose
proscribed role had called for him/her to actual-ize the realization of
the effects of mankind&#39;s enslavement to Original Sin, sothis new
archipelago of Otherness will be made to signify the realization ofthe
new reformulation&#39;s posited &quot;absence of order,&quot; or postulate of
&quot;signifi-cant ill,&quot; defined now in economic terms. And &quot;curable,&quot;
therefore, only ineconomic terms.</p>

context of the intellectual revolu-tion of Liberal or economic (rather
than civic) political humanism that isbeing brought in from the end of
the eighteenth century onwards by theintellectuals of the bourgeoisie,
together with their redefinition of Man1 inthe purely secular and now
biocentric terms of Man2 that these new sciencesare going to be made

Man1---as ithad been known, therefore, in the terms of Foucault&#39;s
classical episteme,with these terms serving to validate the hegemony
of the owners of landedrather than of moveable wealth, or capital. Yet
it is also in the terms of thisspecific political project that the
fundamental paradox of the DarwinianRevolution emerges, one that links
the imperatively secured bottom role ofthe Black Diaspora peoples---as
well as the systemic expendability of theglobal Poor, of the jobless,
the homeless, the underdeveloped---to the issueraised earlier with

To sum up: it is in this context that a new principle of
nonhomogeneity,that of Dubois&#39;s Color Line in its white/nonwhite,
Men/Natives form (i.e., asdrawn between the lighter and the darker
races), will now be discursivelyand institutionally deployed as a
&quot;space of Otherness&quot; on which to project animagined and extrahumanly
(because ostensibly bio-evolutionarily) deter-mined nonhomogeneity of
genetic substance between the category of thoseselected-by-Evolution
and the category of those dysselected-by-Evolution.The Color (cum
Colonial) Line would, therefore, be made to reoccupy theplaces earlier
occupied by the Heaven/Earth, supralunar/sublunar, and bythe rational
humans/irrational animals premises of nonhomogeneity inorder to enable
the selected/dysselected, and thus deserving/undeservingstatus
organizing principle that it encoded to function for the

functionedfor the ecclesiastical-cum-medieval aristocratic order of
Latin-ChristianEurope (Le Goff 1988). So that where the ranking rule of
superiority/inferi-ority accepted and internalized by all the subjects
of the medieval order ofEurope had been that of differential degrees of
redemption from enslave-ment to the Fallen Flesh, degrees therefore of
religious merit (with the&quot;learned&quot; scholars of the order, as Le Goff
points out, obsessively pridingthemselves on their ability to keep
themselves chaste and sexually continenton feast days, at the same time
as they stigmatized the peasants as peoplewho, unlike them, gave in to
their lustful and carnal desires, thereby fallingto the level of beasts
[Le Goff 1988]), in the case of the bourgeoisie, the rank-ing rule
would be a transumed form of the first. As such, therefore, it wouldcome
to be based on degrees of selected genetic merit (or eugenics)
versusdifferential degrees of the dysselected lack of this merit:
differential degreesof, to use the term made famous by <em>The Bell Curve</em>,
&quot;dysgenicity.&quot;\
It is this new master code, one that would now come to function at

orientation,superior/inferior ethnicities, and that of the
Investor/Breadwinners versusthe criminalized jobless Poor (Nas&#39;s &quot;black
and latino faces&quot;) and WelfareMoms antithesis, and most totally between
the represented-to-be superiorand inferior races and cultures---that
would come to function as the duallystatus-organizing and integrating
principle of U.S. society. So that if, beforethe sixties, the enforced
segregation of the Black population in the South asthe liminally deviant
category of Otherness through whose systemic nega-tion the former Civil
War enemies of North and South, together with the vastwave of incoming
immigrants from Europe, would be enabled to experiencethemselves as a We
(that is, by means of the shared similarity of their now-canonized
&quot;whiteness&quot;), in addition, their segregated status had servedanother
central function. This had been that of enabling a U.S.
bourgeoisie,rapidly growing more affluent, to dampen class conflict by
inducing theirown working class to see themselves, even where not

altruistically bonded with theirdominant middle classes by the fact of

middle class was/is to have to accept one&#39;sostensible dysselection.
This premise had induced in the white, blue-collar(non-middle) working
classes&#39; status a deeply destructive form of self-hatred, whose
corrosive force could only be assuaged by institutionalizedmechanisms,
whether those of the school curricula as noted by Carter G.Woodson in
1933, or that of outright segregation of (as well as of multipleother
forms of discrimination against) the Black U. S. population
group.Seeing that it was and is only such mechanisms that can enable
the white,blue-collar working classes, as well as the white poor, to
experience them-selves as having been selected, although not in class
terms, at least as mem-bers, together with their bourgeoisie, of the
highly selected and thus highly&quot;deserving&quot; white race. With this being
so proved, ostensibly, by the fact ofthe empirical dominance and
supremacy of whites as a group over all othernonwhite races and, most
totally, over their &quot;racial&quot; anti-type Other, theBlack American---as
the group whose Negroid physiognomy and origin con-tinent/Africa prove
them, within the terms of the Darwinian Imaginary, tobelong to the
category of humans most totally of all peoples
dysselected-by-Evolution. The bottommost role of Black Americans in
the United States issystemically produced, since it is the ostensible
proof of their alleged dysse-lected &quot;undeservingness&quot; that then
functions as the central psychic com-pensatory mechanism for the white
working class, at the same time as thismechanism induces them to
continue to see/experience themselves as alsobeing, in terms of class,
&quot;dysselected by Evolution&quot;---a perception thatinduces them to accept
their own class-subordinated status, as well as thehegemony of their
middle classes.</p>

<p>The Negroid physiognomy and its continent of origin, Black
Africa,together with the dark-skinned poorer peoples assimilated to its
categoryhave been made to function within the terms of our present
biocentric con-ception of the human, as well as of its related
&quot;formulation of a general orderof existence&quot; (whose postulate of
&quot;significant ill&quot; is that of a dual mode ofNatural Scarcity---that is, a
scarcity of fully genetically selected humanbeings, on the one hand, and
of material resources on the other), as the actu-alized embodiment, no
longer of the human made degenerate by sin andtherefore fallen to the
status of the apes, but of the human totally dysse-lected, barely
evolved, and as such intermediate between &quot;true&quot; humans andthe primates.
As such, the marker of that most totally dysselected-by-Evolution mode
of non-being that each individual and group must strive toavoid,
struggle to prove that they themselves are not, if they are to be.\
A parallel and interlinked role is also played by the category of the
Poor,the jobless, the homeless, the &quot;underdeveloped,&quot; all of whom,
interned intheir systemically produced poverty and expendability, are
now made tofunction in the reoccupied place of the Leper of the medieval
order and ofthe Mad of the monarchical, so as to actualize at the
economic level thesame dysgenic or dysselected-by-Evolution conception.
With the post-Sixties&#39; reordering of society, &quot;Negroid&quot; physiognomy and
skin color will bemade to coalesce with the inner city status of poverty
and joblessness, crime,and drugs. They will do so together with those
brown Latino faces assimi-lated to its status as this status, a new
Liminal category, enables the incor-poration of the socially mobile
Black middle class into the normative orderof things, if still at a
secondary level. The metaphysical dread of this&quot;Negroid&quot; presence by the
&quot;normal&quot; subjects of the order will lead logicallyto Nas Escobar&#39;s
&quot;taxpayers&quot; being eager to pay for more jails for Black andLatin faces;
eager to see poor women taken off welfare and kept &quot;out of plainsight.&quot;
Since here, again, it is not as men, women, and children that they
arebeing condemned. It is as &quot;the name of what is evil.&quot;\
Here, the dimensions of the fundamental paradox that lies at the core
ofthe Darwinian answer to the question of who we are (when seen from
theperspective of the goal of unsettling our present coloniality of
power, ofbeing) emerges. The paradox is this: that for the &quot;descriptive
statement&quot; that</p>

naturalorganism (thereby projecting it as preexisting the narratively

being, ontogeny that preexists cul-ture, sociogeny), it must ensure
the functioning of strategic mechanismsthat can repress all knowledge
of the fact that its biocentric descriptivestatement is a descriptive
statement. Yet that such strategic, Godelier-typemechanisms of
occultation, repressing recognition that our present descrip-tive
statement of the human is a descriptive statement, are able to
functionat all (if outside our conscious awareness) is itself directly
due to the factthat, as Terrence W. Deacon points out in his 1997 book
<em>The Symbolic Species:The Co-Evolution of Language and the Brain</em>,
humans have been pre-adapted,primarily through the co-evolution of
language and the brain, to be a sym-bolic and, therefore, a
self-representing species.\
In consequence, if it was the functioning of these symbolic,
representa-tional, behavior-motivating/demotivating processes as it
has to do with thestigmatizing portrayal of women as intellectually
inferior, made by &quot;angrymale professors,&quot; that Virginia Woolf had
brilliantly zeroed in on (in heressay <em>A Room of One&#39;s Own</em>), it was
also this same &quot;representational process,&quot;as expressed in the
curriculum and order of knowledge of the United States,that the Black
American educator Carter G. Woodson was to identify in his1933
<em>Miseducation of the Negro</em> as functioning in a parallel manner as
abehavior-motivating/demotivating mechanism. This, seeing that, as
hepointed out, the curriculum&#39;s systemic canonization/positive marking
of allthings European and Euro-American, and no less systemic
stigmatization/negative marking of all things African/Afro-American
clearly had anextracognitive function. This function was one that, by
motivating whites(by representing their ancestors as having done
everything worthwhiledoing), and as lawlikely demotivating Blacks (by
representing theirs as hav-ing done nothing), ensured the stable
reproduction of the U.S. order thatcalled for the white population
group as a whole to be at the apex of thesocial order, and for the
Black population group to be at the bottom(Woodson 1933). With this

dysselected-by-Evolution nature of the other, and thereby the principle
of nonhomo-geneity that is mapped upon the &quot;space of Otherness&quot; of the
Color Line in itsmost total white/Black forms. As the line from which
the status-orderingprinciple, based upon differential degrees of
selectedness/dysselectednessand functioning at all levels of the order,
is transformatively generated,thereby enabling the subjects of our
orders to continue to experience it asthe realization of a true, because
ostensibly extrahumanly determined, order. If we see both Woolf&#39;s and
Woodson&#39;s insights as insights into the work-ings of the symbolic
representation processes instituting of our presentgenre of the human,
Man, and therefore as insights into the necessarilyadaptive truth-for
nature of the overall system of knowledge that is enactingof these
processes, then the following linkages can be made. Linkages notonly to
Aimé Césaire&#39;s recognition of the same &quot;demotivating&quot; processes atwork
in ensuring the subordination of the decolonized in his <em>Discourse
onColonialism</em> (1960), but also to the multiple challenges mounted
during thesixties---both at the global level by anticolonial activists
and by activists inEurope, and then in the United States by Blacks and a
range of other non-white groups, together with feminists and Gay
Liberationists---with all call-ing in question the systemic nature of
their negative markings as nongenericor abnormal Others to a series of
positively marked generic norms. If thissame overall representation
process was to be followed up post-sixties byEdward Said&#39;s more in-depth
elaboration of Césaire&#39;s thesis with respect toOrientalism, the same
linkage can also be made several centuries backwardto Las Casas&#39;s
profound challenges to what he called the &quot;slandering&quot; of theindigenous
peoples as a function of the legitimating not only of the expro-priation
of their lands, but also of their expulsion, as &quot;such a large part
ofGod&#39;s creation,&quot; from human status. Since what joins all of these
challenges,from that of Las Casas to all those of our contemporary
order, is, theArgument proposes, their profound challenge to the
overrepresentation ofMan, in both of its variants: to, thereby, the
coloniality of being, power, truth,freedom to which such an
overrepresentation leads.\

outside the terms of any one member of theclass of such principles,

recognition on our part. A recognition in which we cancome to see
ourselves as a contemporary, increasingly westernized (in theterms of
Man) population, who, as in the case of all other genre-specifichuman

throughsymbolic, representational processes that have, hitherto,
included thosemechanisms of occultation by means of which we have been
able to makeopaque to ourselves the fact that we so do. While it was a
parallel recogni-tion that some half a century ago led Aimé Césaire
(because coming fromthe same standpoint of liminal deviance to our
present ethnoclass norm ofbeing human as did Fanon) to put forward his
cognitively emancipatory pro-posal for a new science able to complete
the natural sciences.\
The natural sciences (Césaire had argued in a talk given in Haiti,
entitled&quot;Poetry and Knowledge&quot;) are, in spite of all their dazzling
triumphs withrespect to knowledge of the natural world, half-starved.
They are half-starved because they remain incapable of giving us any
knowledge of ouruniquely human domain, and have had nothing to say to
the urgent prob-lems that beleaguer humankind. Only the elaboration of
a new science,beyond the limits of the natural sciences (he had then
proposed), will offerus our last chance to avoid the large-scale
dilemmas that we must now con-front as a species. This would be a
science in which the &quot;study of the Word&quot;---of our narratively
inscribed, governing sociogenic principles, descriptivestatement, or
code of symbolic life/death, together with the overall
symbolic,representational processes to which they give rise---will
condition the &quot;studyof nature&quot; (Césaire 1946, 1990). The latter as

<p>terms we then come to experience ourselves as this or that genre/mode
ofbeing human. Yet, with this process taking place hitherto outside our
con-scious awareness, and thereby leading us to be governed by the
&quot;imaginedends&quot; or postulates of being, truth, freedom that we lawlikely
put and keepin place, without realizing that it is we ourselves, and not
extrahuman enti-ties, who prescribe them.\
In his introduction to Fanon&#39;s <em>Les damnés de la terre</em> (The Wretched
ofthe Earth), J. P. Sartre zeroed in on the parallel dilemma of
&quot;colonized&quot; nativeintellectuals who find themselves/ourselves in a
situation in which theMan/Native dichotomy can be seen as an exact
parallel of the clergy/laitydichotomy as it existed towards the end of
the Middle Ages. Like the clergyintellectuals then, now it is the
intellectuals of Man who &quot;own the Word,&quot;while, like the pre-Renaissance
lay intellectuals, it is the &quot;native&quot; intellectu-als (and postcolonially
speaking, the intellectuals of the subordinated andeconomically
impoverished world) who now have only the use of Man&#39;sWord, who
therefore can only &quot;echo.&quot; That is, who must think, write, and
pre-scribe policies, however oppositionally so, in the terms of the very
biocen-tric paradigms that prescribe the subordination and
impoverishment of thevast majority of the worlds to which they/we
belong; since paradigms elab-orated in the very terms of the descriptive
statement of the human, in whoselogic the non-Western, nonwhite peoples
can only, at best, be assimilated ashonorary humans (as in the case of
the &quot;developed&quot; Japanese and otherlighter-skinned Asians) and, at the
worst, must (as in the case of Nas&#39;s &quot;blackand 1atino faces&quot;) forcibly
be proscribed from human status by means of therapidly expanding U.S.
prison-industrial system; as itself, a central mecha-nism of the overall
archipelagoes of the poverty-producing institutions ofthe Third and
Fourth Worlds, archipelagoes that are the major costs paid forthe
ongoing production, realization, and reproduction of our present
ethn-oclass genre of the human, of its overrepresentation as if it were
isomorphicwith the human, its well being, and notion of freedom, with
those that wouldhave to be brought into existence, were the well-being
of the human to bemade into the referent imperative.\

insulation fromwhat is human that is increasingly made evident by the
ossification of ourpresent order of knowledge and its biocentric
paradigms, so Fanon&#39;s &quot;self-assertion,&quot; his concentration on finding
the lost motives, related no longerto Man&#39;s but to our human
self-interest, was to be effected by means of aredescription parallel
to that by means of which the lay humanists hadinvented Man and its
Human Others in the reoccupied place of the Christiangenre of the
human and its pagan/idolator/Enemies-of-Christ/Christ-killer/infidel
Others. Nevertheless, while these lay humanist intellectualshad indeed
effected a redescriptive statement by means of which they secu-larized
human existence, detaching it from the supernatural agency of
thedivine realm, they had done so only by opening the pathway that
wouldeventually lead, with Darwin, to a new descriptive statement,
itself re-anchored in the no less extrahuman agency of Evolution,
thereby reducingthe human within the terms of a biocentric &quot;human
sciences&quot; paradigm tobeing a &quot;mere mechanism&quot; driven in its behavior
by its genetic programs---and, as such, subject to the processes of
natural causation, rather than to theontogeny/sociogeny or
nature-culture modality of causation, which alonecould enable (as
Fanon brilliantly glimpsed) the reflexively self-aversivebehavior of
many westernized Black peoples, made into the Other to ourpresent
ethnoclass norm of being human, to repress the genetic
instinctualnarcissism defining of all modes of purely organic life.
And what Fanon&#39;s newanswer to the question of who/what we are (its
revalorizing &quot;descriptivestatement&quot; detached now from any form of
extrahuman agency or author-ship, theocentric or biocentric) enables
us to come to grips with is preciselysuch a new mode of causation,
thereby, with the still-to-be-explained puzzleof (human)
consciousness(es), doing so outside the terms of our present&quot;Two
Culture&quot; order of knowledge and its adaptive &quot;regime of truth&quot; basedon
the biocentric disciplinary paradigms in whose terms we at present
knowour social reality; this, as the indispensable condition of our

there-fore of our dual descriptive statements and thereby of our
modes/genres ofbeing human, doing so from the perspective of a poet---in
1988, the physicistHans Pagel would make a parallel call in his 1988
book <em>The Dream of Reason:The Computer and the Rise of the Sciences of
Complexity</em>. His call, too, wasfor a new frontier to be opened onto a
nonadaptive mode of human self-cog-nition: onto the possibility,
therefore, of our fully realized autonomy of feel-ings, thoughts,
behaviors.\
The true leap, Fanon wrote at the end of his <em>Black Skins, White
Masks</em>,consists in introducing invention into existence. The buck stops
with us.</p>
