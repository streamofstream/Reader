<p>IN 2001, science and technology studies (STS) made an appearance as a card-carrying field in the <em>International Encyclopedia of Social and Behavioral Sciences</em> or <em>IESBS</em> (Smelser &amp; Baltes 2001). This validated years of effort by many scholars to establish the social studies of sci ence and technology as a recognized, and recognizable, domain of intellectual activity. As a member of that network and as the editor of the <em>IESBS</em> section on STS, I was understand ably elated, even though putting the section together entailed many difficult and unforeseen choices of what to include or exclude in defining the field.&#39; Even then, STS was not counted as a discipline, a label reserved for fields with well-established, one-word names (e.g., anthro pology, economics, history, law, philosophy), and for branches of psychology. Instead, STS was classified as an &quot;intersecting field;&#39; a rubric shared with a cluster of relatively recent, amorphous, and ill-assorted domains of study such as genetics and society, gender studies, religious studies, and behavioral and cognitive neuroscience. Unlike media studies or public policy however, STS was not demoted to the status of &quot;application:• It took its place in the roster of the social sciences as a well-demarcated territory on the map of knowledge. </p>
<p>This review asks what major contributions STS has made to research and teaching, and </p>
<p>what have been its principal successes and failures inside and outside academia. How does the future look for STS? Responses to these questions help shed light on the meanings and challenges of interdisciplinarity, illuminating the potential that spaces between disciplines offer for novel constellations of inquiry to enhance human self-awareness, social under standing, and  public action.  At  the same time, the track record of STS shows how difficult it is to populate  those  in-between  spaces  with  well-trained  scholars,  new  curricular  offerings,  and  long-term  research programs. At the heart of the story are questions about the capacity of STS to overcome entrenched status differentials among disciplines, especially between the humanistic social sciences and the powerful enterprises of university-based science, medi cine, and engineering. </p>
<p>&#39; I had already coedited the second edition of the field&#39;s own handbook (Jasanoff et al. 1995), but inclusion in the <em>IESBS</em> meant more explicitly </p>
<p>staking out a claim for STS in relation to other disciplines. </p>

<p><strong>1. AN INTERDISCIPLINARY HISTORY</strong> </p>
<p>At the risk of oversimplification, and of flattening important cross-cultural differences, STS can be seen as a merger of two broad streams of mid-twentieth-century scholarship.2  One looks at the <em>nature</em> and <em>practices</em> of science and technology (S&amp;T) </p>
<p>as social institutions pos sessing distinctive normative commitments, structures, practices, and discourses that nev ertheless change over time and vary across cultural contexts. The other is mainly concerned with the <em>impacts</em> and <em>control</em> of science, and even more of technology, with particular focus on the risks that S&amp;T pose to human values such as health and safety, peace, security, privacy, community, democracy, development, and environmental  sustainability. The consolidation of STS at the beginning of the twenty-first century is largely a consequence of these once discrete lines of concern coming together around a shared core of theoretical orientations, research methods, texts, and topics, undergirded by new professional infrastructures (e.g., programs, departments, textbooks, journals, societies). Thus, STS is the product of decades of effort by people who perceived important gaps in the academic analysis ofS&amp;T, and who gradually, painstakingly, and with mixed success built institutional foundations to support the missing research and teaching. </p>
<p>The resulting field is interdisciplinary in a sense that can best be captured through a car tographic metaphor. Underlying the idea of interdisciplinarity are two ideal-typical maps of preexisting disciplines. <strong>In</strong> one, all the disciplines are tightly lined  up, one against another, as in a map of the contiguous United States, with shared boundaries and  no gaps between; in the other, as <strong>in</strong> a map of the Indonesian archipelago, the disciplines are idiosyncratically bounded islands, scattered across a </p>
<p>sea  of  ignorance,  with  unexplored  waters  in  between.3 On  the  first  map,  a  new  &quot;interdiscipline&quot;  comes  into  being principally through exchanges among scholars belonging to oneor another established disciplinary community and trained </p>
<p>in  its  forms  of  reasoning  and  research  practices.  On  the  second,  an  <em>&quot;interdiscipline&quot;</em>  is  liter  ally  that-an  autonomous formation situated among other disciplines. Such a field may arise in response to new concerns in society, such as the pervasive sense of uncertainty that pro pelled Ulrich Beck&#39;s <em>Risk Society</em> to unexpected popularity in the wake of the Chernobyl acci dent (Beck 1992). Exploration of novel topics, prompting theoretical and methodological innovation, can coalesce into a new culture of knowledge making with its own native habits of production and exchange. Science and technology studies looks more like the latter than </p>
<p>2     The story told in this chapter is unavoidably US- and Euro-centric, given the author&#39;s experiences and knowledge limitations. However, STS is an increasingly international field, whose past, present, and future rest on global networks of scholarship and exchange. One way to strengthen the account offered here would be to trace parallel genealogies of the emergence of STS from other national and regional vantage points, particularly in emerging industrial  societies. lhat  is an impossible  undertaking in a chapter of this scope. Yet, the coming together of those histories, and the resulting strands of theorizing and research, in the global academic marketplace  will undoubtedly contribute  to STS&#39;s future strength and liveliness. </p>
<p>3 Note that the two alternatives captured by my cartographic metaphor correspond roughly to the categories of multidisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity presented in Klein&#39;s taxonomy in this volume. The taxonomic approach, however, does not problematize the taken-for-grantedness of disciplinary boundaries, nor emphasize their contingency or question their claims to coherence as I implicitly do in this chapter. </p>

<li><strong>The Nature and Practices of Science and Technology</strong></li>

</ol>
<p>From  the  interwar  period  to  the  start  of  the  Cold  War,  sociologists  and  historians,  and  not  infrequently  scientists, engineers, and social activists, became interested in the relationship between scientific practice and its work products. Thomas Kuhn&#39;s hugely influential <em>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> is a well-known example (Kuhn 1962). Kuhn&#39;s work helped turn scholarly attention away from the theoretical content and coherence of scientific claims to the social means of their production. His book helped crystallize a new approach to the history of science in which scientific facts were  seen  as  products  of  scientists&#39;  communal  knowledge-generating  efforts,  conditioned  by  specific  contexts  of discovery. This shift led to an effort by a group of mainly British scholars to probe how far questions about the nature of science once asked mainly by philosophers could be productively reframed as questions about how science works (Bloor </p>
<p>1976). Their inquiries produced a distinctive school of&quot;soci ology of scientific knowledge&quot; (SSK)4 located in centers for &quot;science studies&quot; at a number of UK universities, including Edinburgh and Bath, in the 1970s. The aim of SSK was more imperial than interdisciplinary: It was to render social what had previously been seen as mainly epistemic (how scientists think); it was to appropriate for the qualitative and inter pretive social sciences what had once belonged to philosophy (by asking what scientists do, how they do it, and how their work achieves authority). </p>
<p>While  SSK  was  emerging  from  struggles  between  philosophy  and  sociology  of  science, scholars  from  other backgrounds recognized the value of ethnographic methods for study ing scientists at work. An early, influential exemplar of this approach was the 1979 book by Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar, <em>Laboratory Life: The Social Construction of Scientific Facts;</em> the word &quot;social&quot; was dropped from the 1986 edition. In this and subsequent writing, Latour urged students of science to &quot;follow the scientist&quot; if they wished to understand how obser vations in the lab or the field turn into facts (Latour 1987). Participant-observation proved a useful tool for exploring the cultural dynamics of different scientific disciplines  (phys  ics,  molecular  biology,  genomics,  climate  modeling)  and  organizations  (&quot;big  science;&#39;  uni  versity laboratories,  interdisciplinary  research  centers).  Latour,  together  with  his  colleague  Michel  Callon,  a  sociologist  of technology and, later, the market in the Paris-based school of STS, also produced important works on the relations between the human and nonhu man or the social and material elements of S&amp;T. Their &quot;actor-network theory&quot; (ANT), which urges symmetrical treatment of human and nonhuman agents, known as &quot;actants;&#39; emerged  as another salient direction in STS research. By highlighting the material elements </p>
<p>4 SSK contrasted, in particular, with then dominant trends in US sociology of science, which concentrated more on the social organization and roles of scientists than on their specific knowledge producing practices. American sociology of science was led by a number of distinguished practitioners, such as Robert K. Merton of Columbia, but their work increasingly diverged in aims and methods from the more epistemologically, metaphysically, and semiotically inclined European schools. </p>

<p>of knowledge networks, ANT foregrounded technology as an increasingly more significant object ofSTS study. </p>
<p>A third important research tradition looked at science and technology as distinctive cul </p>
<p>tural  formations.  Engaging  anthropologists,  feminists,  postcolonial  scholars,  discourse  ana lysts,  and  other  theorists oflanguage and power, this body of work crossed the line between the humanities and the social sciences, particularly in its preoccupation with the meanings people attach to the products of S&amp;T. In works such as Donna Haraway&#39;s (1989) investiga tions of primatology or Evelyn Fox Keller&#39;s (1986) studies on gender and science, cultural studies of science and technology questioned how social power translates into scientific authority and vice versa. A flourishing body of scholarship emerged around medical S&amp;T, focusing on such topics as reproductive  medicine, patient activism, and hereditary dis ease; unlike classical studies of the physical sciences and technologies, these more human centered investigations emphasized themes of identity and subjectivity, especially of those affected by disease classifications. More generally, an influx of research funds from the Human Genome Project spurred broad-based exploration of the ethical, legal, and social implications of genetics and genomics, contributing new normative dimensions to cultural studies of the life sciences and technologies. Less common but equally agenda-setting was work on the relations between science and other powerful institutions, such as law, poli tics, and religion; these works highlighted the impact of cultural norms of legitimacy and reasonableness on the production and reception of policy-relevant scientific facts (Jasanoff 1990, 2005). </p>

<li><strong>The Invention ofTechnoscience</strong></li>

</ol>
<p>Unlike  historians  of  science  and  of  technology,  who  maintain  separate  identities  through  professional  training  and associations,  STS  scholars  made  a  point  of  integrating  their  studies  of  scientific  discovery  with  analyses  of  the technological systems that support or result from advances in science. The term &quot;technoscience;&#39; widely used in STS research  and the name of the newsletter issued by the Society for Social Studies of Science (4S), signals a deep commit ment to the view that S&amp;T are inextricably intertwined. STS scholarship asserts that tech nological innovation would not be possible without scientific problem-solving; in reverse,  scientific discovery could not proceed without technologies to enable new experimental methods and approaches. Accordingly, in studying high-energy physics or molecular biol ogy, bakelite  or  musical  synthesizers,  stem  cells  or  Golden  Rice,  the  Internet  or  the  human  genome,  STS  researchers  pay particular attention to the interplay of ideas, instruments, and materials in the practices of the discoverers, inventors, and users of S&amp;T. By using the term &quot;technoscience;&#39; the field draws its own distinctive boundaries around the subject matter it investigates. </p>
<p>The third handbook of STS sponsored by the Society for Social Studies of Science, one of the field&#39;s major professional societies (Hackett et al. 2007; for an earlier survey of the field, see Jasanoff et al. 1995) is illustrative. The handbook&#39;s final section, headed &quot;Emergent Technosciences;&#39; deals with systems that cross the lines between the cognitive and the mate rial as well  as  the  natural  and  the  social.  This  section  includes  articles  on  genomics,  medical  biotechnologies,  finance, environment, communications, and nanotechnology. All are areas in which scientific and technological breakthroughs are intimately connected, conform to </p>

<p>no straightforward temporal or causal relationships, and depend on multifaceted engage ment by actors ranging from individual  discoverers,  inventors,  and  entrepreneurs  to  expert  communities,  economic  sponsors,  policy  makers,  and consuming (or sometimes resisting) publics. </p>
<ol start='3' >
<li><strong>Impacts and Control of Science and Technology</strong></li>

</ol>
<p>The second major thrust within STS derives from scientists&#39;-and increasingly citizens&#39; and social movements&#39;-concerns about the impacts ofS&amp;T developments on health, safety, and fundamental human values. The dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and the ensuing nuclear arms race between the United States and the former Soviet Union initiated a new politics of technological anxiety. Themes of scientists&#39; complicity in war and violence, and technology&#39;s lack of democratic accountability, grew in prominence during the Vietnam War, which also helped link earlier worries about the ungovernability of science with nascent concerns about S&amp;T&#39;s environmental implications. The marine biolo gist Rachel Carson&#39;s book <em>Silent Spring</em> (Carson 1962), an attack on indiscriminate chemi cal  use widely credited with  launching  the  modern  US  environmental  movement,  appeared  in  the  same  year  as  Kuhn&#39;s  book  on  scientific revolutions. More recently, genetic, informa tion, neuro-, and nanotechnologies, and their rapid convergence in areas such as  synthetic  biology,  have  aroused  new  fears  about  risks  to  individuals  and  society.  Observers  question  whether  the benefits of these promising developments might be offset by erosions of lib erty, privacy, autonomy, equality, and other cherished liberal ideals. At the limit, questions have arisen about assaults on human nature itself, with the ascendance of the computer and associated forms of standardization and control into intimate bodily functions, social rela tionships, and autonomy of will and thought. Increasingly, too, the consequences of global imbalances in S&amp;T innovation, and their implications for human rights and social justice, have emerged  as centers of gravity for STS scholarship and cross- national collaboration. </p>
<p>In  the late 1960s, several  US universities, including Cornell, Harvard, MIT, Penn State, and Stanford, reacted to these developments by forming programs in &quot;science, technol ogy, and society&quot; (also abbreviated as STS). Founded, and often led, by senior scientists or engineers-experienced in science advice and policy formation, these programs presumed that STS work had to be cross-disciplinary in the sense of highway-building described above, engaging natural scientists and engineers, as well as humanists, social scientists, and prac titioners in law, business, and public policy. Preoccupied with social problem-solving, the founders of  US STS programs presumed  that good STS research demanded familiarity with the technical content of S&amp;T. This meant in turn that early contributions to research and teaching were made by scientists (or ex-scientists) and engineers, or by teams that included technically trained researchers.  Humanists and social scientists were tacitly assumed to have no significant independent insights into the functioning of S&amp;T, although their participa tion was considered essential for illuminating the &quot;soft;&#39; value-laden, societal dimensions of S&amp;T. Cornell&#39;s STS program provides a small marker of these attitudes and assumptions. It was established in 1969 by a chemist (Franklin Long), <strong>a</strong> physicist (Raymond Bowers), a biol ogist (Richard  D. O&#39;Brien), and a philosopher oflanguage and mathematics (Max Black). </p>
<p>The prominent role of scientists and engineers helped establish the credibility of STS research in its early years, but it also introduced several constraints: emphasis on empirical </p>
<p>178  A FIELD OF ITS OWN <img src="Aspose.Words.98fd919b-d7a0-41ad-902f-c055494f13b2.010.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><img src="Aspose.Words.98fd919b-d7a0-41ad-902f-c055494f13b2.011.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p>case studies rather than social theory; reaffirmation of scientists&#39; necessarily partial percep tions about the cultures and practices  of  S&amp;T;  reliance  on  anecdotal  practitioner  narratives  rather  than  systematic  research  to  explain  science- technology-society relationships; and acceptance of public &quot;scientific illiteracy&quot; as the favored explanation for popular concerns about S&amp;T. The topics treated by first-generation STS scholars also reflected some of these limitations. Case studies of the public controversies of the day (airports, nuclear power, supersonic transport, vaccines, environmental pollution) took center stage, with results sometimes indistinguishable from robust journalism. More problematically, such research failed to win the interest of major scholars in established humanistic or social scientific disci plines, and many STS programs  in the United States, such as Harvard&#39;s and Cornell&#39;s, either died a quiet death or substantially lost momentum by the mid-197os. </p>
<p>One should note too that STS scholars in the 1970s drew on fairly conventional social the ory to explain why science became  political-for  example,  attributing  technical  controver  sies  to  differences  in  participants&#39;  taken-for-granted interests; hence they neither drew on nor contributed  to seminal insights in other fields. At a time when many social sciences were turning to quantitative methods and rational choice theory, it was easy to dismiss qualitative, case-specific STS  findings  as  merely  anecdotal  or  subjective.  Unlike  the  scholars  preoccu  pied  with  the  practices  of  scientists, however,  researchers  focusing on the impact and control of S&amp;T were drawn from the first to issues of power and governance. Their work highlighted how dominant processes of technical decision-making tended to marginalize weaker social groups; neo-Marxist theorists tied these dynamics to class, capital, and hegemonic beliefs, whereas feminists argued that gendered power structures drove developments in S&amp;T. In these respects, even first-generation STS research shared significant concerns with later sociocultural studies of S&amp;T. Openings existed for a productive synthesis, which began in the United States in the late 1980s under the increasingly common rubric of &quot;science and technology studies:&#39; </p>
<ol start='4' >
<li><strong>Common Ground</strong></li>

</ol>
<p>Convergence between the two major precursors of contemporary STS-work on the nature of scientific production and on  the  impacts  of  S&amp;T-occurred  on  both  intellectual  and  institutional  levels.  Maturing  research  programs  brought scattered projects and practitio ners into closer communion and helped define common theoretical approaches and topical interests. In brief, research on the nature of science became more concerned with how social understandings or arrangements are taken up into the production of knowledge and arti facts, while research on the impacts of S&amp;T recognized that the interactions of science and society begin long before the material products of technology enter the market and affect lives. As a result, the power ofS&amp;T was  no longer seen as wholly separable  from  other kinds of power. Nor were the formation and application of knowledge considered entirely distinct from their eventual uses and impacts. Thus, the ways in which science&#39;s epistemic authority interpenetrates other kinds of social and psychological authority emerged as a major thread in the field&#39;s evolving agenda of inquiry. </p>
<p>By the end of the 1990s, a new generation of STS scholars began examining issues such </p>
<p>as the following: the nature of expertise in various historical  periods and  cultural set tings; the resources used to forge agreement on &quot;facts&quot;; the relationship between scientific </p>
<p>AN INTERDISCIPLINARY HISTORY  179 <img src="Aspose.Words.98fd919b-d7a0-41ad-902f-c055494f13b2.012.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p>representations and wider visual culture; the disciplining effects of instruments, measuring techniques, and administrative routines; the use of nonhuman agents, including model lab organisms such as flies or mice, in the work of science; the methods of maintaining or chal lenging boundaries between scientific, technological, and other cultural practices; and the intermingling of expert and lay cultures around such issues as genetic disease. The field&#39;s long-standing concerns with fact, truth, and method did not vanish, but they &quot;thickened&quot; to include a new preoccupation with how novel ideas, entities, and belief systems appear and make their way in the world (and how old ones die out). More than simply accounting for &quot;truth;&#39; STS  became concerned  with  the social  dimensions  of the accreditation  and diffusion  of  knowledge  and  its technological  manifestations.  There  was  also  growing  interest  among  STS  scholars  of  all  stripes  in  examining  the relations between scientific and other modes of belief, expression, and power: law, literature, culture, religion, art. Science in non-Western contexts was a relatively late-blooming topic, but was included in the 1995 STS handbook and thereafter grew into a significant focus on global S&amp;T.5</p>
<p>With all of these projects on the rise, older disciplinary divisions no longer made much sense within STS, particularly in the training of young scholars. For example, since the field&#39;s research questions centered on the nexus of knowledge and power, cutting across historical periods, budding STS scholars saw benefit from exposure to historiography as well as social theory, ethnography as well as metaphysics, and political as well as moral philosophy. The methods used by some of the best-known senior academics in the field were increasingly dif ficult to localize by discipline. Equally, the work they produced found its way across the field as a whole and into many neighboring disciplines. Science and technology studies books were reviewed in journals running from <em>Science</em> and <em>Nature</em> to the <em>New York Times Book Review</em> and the <em>Times Literary Supplement,</em> with the whole range of the field&#39;s professional journals between. The unifying feature in all cases was the <em>subject</em> of study, namely, human investments in science and technology. </p>
<p>While many STS researchers could still be characterized as mainly anthropologists, histo rians, or sociologists, it seemed  increasingly  more  appropriate  to  distinguish  them  in  relation  to  their  research  fields  and  theoretical commitments.  By the early years of the new century, it became less common to find mature STS scholars who defined themselves in terms of a &quot;pure&quot; discipline (history,  philosophy, sociology, anthropology,  politics, economics) applied to a single science or technology (biology, physics, chemistry, engineering, medicine, risk analysis). Textbooks introducing students to STS reflected this cross-disciplinary synthe sis, although, reflecting the authors&#39; early disciplinary training, these works approached STS variously from more sociological (Collins &amp; Pinch 1993), anthropological (Hess 1997), or philosophical (Cutcliffe 2000; Sismondo 2010) perspectives. </p>
<p>To be sure, there was never a complete integration of assumptions and methods across the spectrum of STS, any more than there is between subfields within most traditional disci plines. Specialties endure and thrive, as in any disciplinary context. For example, boundary spanning subjects such as risk, scientific evidence, bioethics, or the public understanding of science figure more prominently in the work of STS scholars descended from the tradition </p>
<p>5 Institutional changes supporting this expansion of the STS agenda include the establishment of the Japanese Society for Science and Technology Studies in 2001, thelaunch of the international journal <em>East Asian Science, Technology and Society</em> in 2007, andtheformation of the </p>
<p>STS-Africa Network in 2011. </p>

<p>of concern with the impacts of science and technology; by contrast, historically or philo sophically trained STS researchers have  tended  to  look  more  at  the  evolution  and  practices  of  disciplinary  scientific  knowledge  and  technological communities. By the same token, attention to visual representation and instrumentation, widespread in historical and cultural studies of science, is less common in the work of those with primary interests in the poli tics of S&amp;T. Ethnographic approaches have been used more often to study lab cultures and patients&#39; groups than, say, environmental controversies or legal proceedings. More gener ally, constructivist theories have made greater headway in contemporary than in historical studies of science and technology, possibly because historical methods are poorly adapted to observations of science in the making. Comparable differences of theory, method, research styles, and topical emphasis, however, may be encountered within the most securely estab lished and coherent disciplines. </p>
<ol start='2' >
<li><strong>ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONALIZATION</strong> </li>

</ol>
<p>Despite its creativity and originality, the branch of STS concerned with the nature and prac tices of contemporary S&amp;T was slow to gain a foothold in university structures. In part, this simply reflected the field&#39;s growing pains: At the turn of the twenty-first century, not many senior scholars of unquestioned eminence identified their careers unambiguously with STS. In part, too, the field suffered from the balkanization that sets in when resources are insuf ficient: Seeing little  benefit from self-identification with STS, young scholars  often  reverted to better-recognized disciplinary affiliations, such as anthropology, history or sociology, or to topical subfields within STS for which there was current market demand, such as bioeth ics, environmental studies, science policy, or even nanotechnology and society. In turn, such moves hampered the recognition of commonalities that cut across the field, with negative consequences for graduate education, which thrives best in a stable environment of accred ited teaching centers and steady job opportunities. </p>
<p>Non-negligibly as well, STS in the 1990s earned a reputation  for relativism  that evoked </p>
<p>scorn from working scientists, other social scientists, and some university administrators. Labeled the &quot;science wars:&#39; a subset of the culture wars then afflicting the universities, those exchanges called into question  whether  constructivist approaches  fairly portray progress in science or advances in technology. Although difficult to document, worries about the field&#39;s intellectual soundness and descriptive accuracy, coming at a time when universities were becoming increasingly dependent on their links to science-based industries, may have inhibited the institutionalization ofSTS in the upper reaches of academia in several Western countries. The widely decried hostility toward science during the US presidency of George W. Bush, coupled  with a growing perception  that scientific progress and technological inno vation are crucial for economic growth, may also have undermined institutional support for scholarship seen as questioning the authority of science. </p>
<p>Until the late 1980s, graduate studies of the nature and role of science and technology in US universities were mostly organized in one of the following ways: departments or programs in the history (and sometimes philosophy) of science and technology (HPST); programs (occa sionally departments) in science, technology, and society (STS); and programs in science, tech nology, and public policy (STPP). These arrangements reflected a number of tacit intellectual </p>

<p>boundaries. Historical and contemporary studies were thought to belong in separate com partments; even at the University of Pennsylvania, where history and sociology of science nominally resided in the same department, the focus remained on social histories of sci ence and medicine. The frequent pairing of history with philosophy of science reflected a union of interests in these fields around the content of scientific ideas. This alliance worked well for &quot;internalist&quot; historians, but less well for  those venturing  into social and cultural his  tory. Another  implicit  boundary  sequestered  studies  of  science, technology,  and  public  policy  within  professional  schools,  as  a  supposedly  &quot;applied&quot;  field,  away  from  the  more &quot;fundamental&quot; humanities and social sciences (as at Harvard, Michigan, and Wisconsin). So conceived, STPP focused more on specific areas of scientific and technological practice than on broader ways of thinking about the nature of S&amp;T. A few programs and departments  did  not  respect  these  divisions,  but  they  mostly  existed  at  engineering  colleges  and technical universities, where they did not compete with traditional disciplines. Members of those programs, too, tended to define themselves as anthropologists, historians, sociologists, or political scientists rather than as rep resentatives of an integrated field ofSTS. </p>
<p>Two external developments in the mid-198os helped to partially remap these configura tions. First, the processes of global academic exchange brought about closer contact between European and North American scholarship, narrowing the gap between research traditions on the two sides of the Atlantic. Bridges were built between the more structuralist and politi cal approaches to studying S&amp;T in the United States and constructivist and philosophical scholarship in Europe. Second,  the  US  National  Science  Foundation  (NSF)  opened  a  nation  wide competition  to support  interdisciplinary graduate training in STS. This initiative led to  the  founding  of  three  successive  programs  in  the  early1990s,  at  the University of California San Diego (UCSD), Cornell University, and the University of Minnesota. The Cornell grant spurred the establishment in 1991 of a Department of Science and Technology Studies in the College of Arts and Sciences. Merging the earlier HPST and STS programs, the new depart ment comprised about a dozen faculty members offering both undergraduate and graduate training in STS. By the late 1990s, all three NSF-supported programs were producing doc torates and postdoctoral trainees who entered the academic market and raised the profile ofSTS. </p>
<p>While such large-scale center awards ended after the first three, the NSF continued to sup port more modest, research- based graduate training in STS. A series of Small Grants for Training and Research (SGTRs) supported limited numbers of graduate students and post docs to work on well-defined themes within the field. SGTR recipients in early years included Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Harvard (JFK School), Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Rensselaer Polytechnic. In addition, the NSF supported conferences and workshops designed to pro mote curricular innovation and theoretical integration under particular thematic headings, such as diversity in science and engineering, or biology and the law. Targeted funding for looking  at  technology&#39;s  social  impacts  and  implications  also  became  available  under  fed  erally  sponsored  research programs such as the Human Genome Project and the National Nanotechnology Initiative; parallel initiatives emerged in Europe and (sometimes) East Asia, although with different funding models and implications for student training. </p>
<p>Unlike the earlier STS programs, the new STS maintained strength where it put down solid institutional roots and made gradual inroads elsewhere. Thus, the NSF-funded pro grams at Cornell, Minnesota, and UCSD added faculty strength over time and, in some cases, branched into new areas of research, such as genomics, information technologies, and </p>
<p>PAGE  A  FIELD  OF ITS OWN </p>
<p>nanotechnology. The STS program at MIT, which already controlled its own faculty lines, also grew during this period, partly by adopting a new doctoral program, although the STS faculty remained organized along mostly disciplinary lines with greatest strengths in history and anthropology. STS departments or programs at some prominent technical universities (e.g., Georgia Tech, Rensselaer Polytechnic, Virginia Polytechnic, University of Virginia School of Engineering and Applied Science) made additional professorial appointments. In the midwest, the University of Michigan appointed STS scholars in several departments and created an STS undergraduate certificate program. The University of Wisconsin, home to well-established history of science and history of medicine departments, appointed a cluster of STS scholars and established a graduate certificate program in STS. Similar developments occurred in the University of California system, especially at Berkeley, Davis, and Santa Cruz, during the early years of the twenty-first century. Rapid expansions in research and graduate training at Arizona State University included a build-up of STS scholars and the establishment in 2008 of a doctoral program in the human and social dimensions of science and technology. </p>
<p>Science and technology studies was recognized as a field of graduate training in a number of northern European countries (Netherlands, Scandinavia, Switzerland, United Kingdom) during the 1970s. Subsequently, from the turn of the century, the European Union began supporting a widening network of universities offering a standardized master&#39;s level curricu lum in STS, administered through the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands in collab oration  with  the European  Interuniversity Association  on  Society, Science and  Technology. In the same period, the French government added a required component of history and phi losophy of science to graduate training in S&amp;T, while other state-funded initiatives looked to strengthen research and training in STS more broadly. Initiatives in Germany included most importantly the STS graduate programs at the University of Bielefeld, a preeminent center for interdisciplinary studies. When STS lost strength at Bielefeld through faculty attrition, research continued in smaller clusters funded by Germany&#39;s &quot;excellence initiative,&quot; as well as programs initiated  by institutions such as the Technical  University of Munich. Several south ern (and eventually eastern) European countries also built strength in STS during the 1990s, usually through professional societies and European research collaborations. Japan formed an STS network of its own in 1990, and by the late 1990s actively participated with China, South Korea, and Taiwan in an East Asian STS network served by its own specialist jour nal and professional meetings. From the mid-199os the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences undertook a major effort to publish STS work, often with an emphasis on the impacts and social control of technology. </p>

<li><strong>RESEARCH FRONTIERS</strong> </li>

</ol>
<p>Interdisciplinary research is often driven by questions that demand input from more than one area of study. Policy research is a prime example: To know how best to control green house emissions from automobiles, one needs to know something about the design of cars, the economics of innovation, the dynamics of the automobile market, the impact of incen tives on consumer behavior, and the laws regulating air pollution at state and federal lev els. No single field or person possesses all the necessary knowledge; collaboration among </p>

<p>disciplinary frameworks and their distinctive knowledge systems-on the model of inter state highway construction-is therefore crucial. Significant developments in STS, however, were driven by questions of a different kind: those that one field sought to appropriate from others, and those that no field had thought to investigate before. In each case, the impetus was to view scientific and technological production as social domains deserving fine-grained study, and thus to bring the full-blown apparatus of social analysis, including interpretive methods, to elucidating those dynamics. The results, in cartographic terms, were consistent with the model of charting the unknown seas to discover new islands ofinsight and learning. Published in 2007, the third edition of <em>The Handbook of Science and Technology Studies</em> ran to 1,080 pages, comprising 38 chapters organized under 5 topical headings (Hackett et al. </p>
<p>2007; for comparison, see also the second handbook edited by Jasanoff et al. 1995). The 2008 </p>
<p>joint meeting of the European and American societies for STS showcased around a thousand presented papers; the 2010 Society for Social Studies of Science meeting, held in Tokyo, fea tured more than 200 sessions. Clearly, any attempt to characterize  the  research  frontiers  rep  resented  by  all  this  activity  risks  simplification  to  the  point  of  caricature. Nevertheless, some broad strokes may convey the unique nature ofSTS&#39;s interdisciplinarity. </p>
<p>Some of the earliest foundations for STS were laid, as we have seen, by sociologists and anthropologists who provided minute  but  eye-opening  accounts  of  the  scientific  practices  that  lead  to  the  creation  of  facts.  The  resulting  genre oflaboratory studies remains a staple of STS, but its focus has widened to include many more dimensions of practice than the moments of significant discovery or revolutionary change that concerned early historians of S&amp;T. The conception of science itself expanded to accommodate wider domains of sys tematic knowledge production and technological uptake, from automobile engineering and weapons development to environmental and financial modeling, the creation of markets and fiscal instruments, and varied indicator systems, such as the metrics used to measure scientific productivity. A second direction was to investigate not just the leading figures associated with breakthroughs and prizes but also the invisible technicians,  instrument  makers,  nurses,  counselors,  forensic  practitioners,  and  even  patent  writers  without  whose involvement  scientific knowledge could not be produced or disseminated  beyond the lab or the clinic. A third extension was to pay closer attention to the myriad nonhuman elements that play a part  in the discovery process, from mice to microscopes to microarrays. </p>
<p>A  more  subtle  shift  occurred  as  researchers  considered  not  only  the  production  of  new  knowledge   but  also  its circulation in society. A seminal history of experimental practices in Restoration England by Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer (1985) called attention to the importance of credibility and witnessing in the spread of experimental science-themes that these and other authors developed in later work. While many STS researchers addressed reception and uptake within expert communities, subsequent work showed that broader social analysis was needed to understand the authority of science in the modern world. Thus, studies of the  public understanding  of science (Wynne 1995)  and science used in public pol icy (Jasanoff 1990, 2005) followed science out of its contexts of production into contexts of interpretation and use, where science acquired substantial power to shape the directions of human advancement and well-being. </p>
<p>Questions of reception-whether inside or outside the circles of scientific practice-are intimately linked  to an abiding STS concern with  the relationship  between science, power, and politics, especially in democratic societies. Although research in this area has shifted in focus and methodology over more than 40 years, it too provides powerful justification for </p>
<p>---  -------··--- - ------ </p>
<p>the acknowledgment ofSTS as a distinct  academic  field.  Salient  insights  include  the  follow ing:  Controversies  are productive social moments, offering windows on the ambiguity of scientific observations and the possible existence of alternative interpretations; technologi cal systems are agents of governance  because, like laws and  social  norms, they both enable and constrain behavior; S&amp;T policies, in both the public and private sector, build on tacit and inarticulate imaginations of what the public wants or needs; public participation and engagement are essential for ensuring that the imaginations of states and industries are held to critical scrutiny and democratic oversight. Some of these findings are now  so  taken  for  granted  that  they  underwrite  operational  rules  of  citizen  participation  in  most  technologi  cally advanced societies; others are inchoate and remain to be translated into political and administrative action. Science and technology studies scholars have become increasingly involved not only in generating knowledge about the relations </p>
<p>between science and politics but also in the translation work needed to convert knowledge to action (Fisher 20 11) .6</p>

<li><strong>OUTLOOK:  BARRIERS  AND  OPPORTUNITIES</strong></li>

</ol>
<p>Some 50 years into the life of a new field, and 15 years into a new century, STS remains weakly institutionalized in the upper reaches of global academia. Despite growing attention to the field&#39;s intellectual contributions, there are few full- fledged  STS  departments  in  the  United  States,  even  fewer  in  Europe,  and  barely  any  in Asia  or  Latin America. Departments, more over, tend to cluster in engineering schools and, with few exceptions, have not taken hold in high- prestige research universities, where STS has to compete with long-established social sciences and humanities. Large hurdles  remain. These are built into the political economy of the disciplines in contemporary higher education, as well as into STS&#39;s own contradictory self-understandings. Briefly, there are three challenges of disciplinarity and interdisciplinar ity that STS will have to overcome before it can take its place as a necessary, indeed indis pensable, component  of higher education: establishing  credible relations  with  its objects of study (S&amp;T); defining its relations to other disciplines; and asserting a stronger sense of its own boundaries and mission. The good news is that STS has the resources to meet all three; the bad news is that STS scholars have not yet chosen as a community systematically to tackle any. </p>
<p>First, STS faces the not inconsiderable difficulties of &quot;studying up&quot;: it presents a classic case of a less established, less accredited field commenting on ones that are far more securely established, generously endowed, and seen as conferring more obvious public  benefits.  It is well known that such power differentials affect the content and credibility of academic analysis. With respect  to science and technology, in particular,  practitioners are often skepti cal that anyone not trained in a technical field could have legitimate things to say about that field&#39;s workings. Indeed, many of the  earliest  entrants  into STS  held  postgraduate  degrees in  science  or  engineering  before  becoming  professional observers of those fields. Physicists </p>
<p>6 Warranting mention in this connection is the entire special issue of <em>Science and Engineering Ethics,</em> Vol. 17, No. 4 (20u), &quot;Science and Technology in the Making: Observation and Engagement:&#39; edited hy Stephanie Bird and Erik Fisher. </p>
<p>OUTLOOK: BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES  185 <img src="Aspose.Words.98fd919b-d7a0-41ad-902f-c055494f13b2.018.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><img src="Aspose.Words.98fd919b-d7a0-41ad-902f-c055494f13b2.019.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><img src="Aspose.Words.98fd919b-d7a0-41ad-902f-c055494f13b2.020.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p>
<p>became historians of physics, while biologists took up the historical or sociological study of biology, and engineers became major contributors to the history of technology. Yet, the requirement that one must be formally qualified in a field in order to speak authoritatively about it not only restricts access but also narrows the analyst&#39;s capacity to ask probing ques tions; an insider perspective develops that neither accommodates nor grasps the benefits of the  outsider&#39;s questioning gaze. A consequence of this attitude in early STS work was to pay disproportionate attention to the production of scientific knowledge in relation to under standing how scientific claims and practices circulate through and are incorporated into society. Only with the emergence of STS as a field of its own has this imbalance between pro duction and reception gradually been righted. </p>
<p>Second, STS has to confront charges of redundancy. Science and technology studies claims special status as &quot;the&quot; field that observes and interprets the work of S&amp;T, but this priv ileged position is by no means universally accepted. Indeed, the traditional </p>
<p>social sciences and humanities at many universities are reluctant to concede any territory to an autonomous STS. Disciplinary scholars insist more or less openly that the map of existing disciplines is good enough to support any of the highways needed for traffic in STS. Thus, it is difficult to persuade a sociologist that STS is not synonymous with the sociology of science, or an anthropologist that anything more than ethnography is needed to study the cultures of sci ence or  technology. Accordingly,  strict  disciplinarians argue that  there is little value to STS as sovereign academic currency. It unlocks no doors to new research questions or meth ods, let alone to successful professional careers. Would-be STS graduate students are often told that they would be better off with a degree in a recognized discipline, with a sideline in studying science or technology. These are,  to some degree, self-serving assessments.  Few of the disciplines named in the <em>JESBS</em> have recognized the study of science and technology as legitimate specialties within their own intellectual configurations. More usual is the reac tion of a political scientist at a major research university who once told me, &quot;My department would never hire someone in the politics of science:&#39; Regrettably, blocking appointments and degree  programs  in STS effectively  dries  up the pipeline of human  resources  dedicated to comprehensive studies of S&amp;T. University administrators for their part can rarely be counted on to create new conditions of possibility. Faced with interdisciplinary boundary struggles and resource constraints, they are more likely to draw back from the hard work </p>
<p>of adjudicating among competing claims, to the disadvantage of any new island in the aca demic high seas. </p>
<p>Third, many scholars who see themselves as members of the STS community are hesi tant  to support  disciplining in either sense of that  term: importing order and coherence into the delightfully unruly territory they came to know as STS in the 1970s; or constituting STS as what some dismissively called a &quot;high-church;&#39; an elitist and exclusionary academic enclave that inhibits free thinking and creativity (see Fuller 1993). External funding initia tives, whether from governments or private donors and foundations, could overcome some of these hesitations, to the point of grounding new programs and reviving old ones (e.g., at Cornell, UCSD, and Wisconsin in the United States). Forging new transdisciplinary iden tities, however, demands an intensity of effort and engagement that seems unnecessary to academics whose own histories are discipline-based. Even  the most secure STS programs in the United States and elsewhere have endured identity crises at some point in their develop ment; at such times, moreover, new fields are substantially more likely than old ones to suc cumb to administrative pressures for efficiency and cost-cutting. </p>
<p>Fields demand organization for their survival and continuity, both to demarcate them from neighboring territories and to set up internal markers by which to measure such academically essential attributes as originality, quality, progress, and contributions to fundamental knowledge. Yet in a field&#39;s emergent, formative phase, attempts to develop a curriculum, create a canon, evaluate students and faculty for professional advancement, or even represent the field in an encyclopedia or handbook all arouse high tension and anxiety. Who will be brought in and celebrated; who will be left out? Many therefore pre fer the quieter option, which is to retain STS as a loosely constructed society to which anyone with a passing interest can gain easy entry. This broad-church approach satisfies liberal academics&#39; deep-seated desire  for  intellectual  democracy,  but  it  also  gets  in  the  way  of  critical  stock-taking,  meaningful  theorizing,  and methodological innovation-in short, of <em>disciplining.</em> In this respect, STS operates as its own most effective critic. It ratifies a sta tus quo that militates against  the field&#39;s maturation  as a self-defining, self-governing area of inquiry. </p>

<li><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></li>

</ol>
<p>The problem of interdisciplinarity is often posed as one of harmonization, or bringing dis parate perspectives into alignment so that different discourses can speak productively with one another. Much as independent nation-states have trouble subordinating their divergent interests and political cultures to agreements on common problems, so the traditional dis ciplines encounter frictions in their efforts to focus on socially salient phenomena-from climate change to the roiling of global financial markets-that seem to demand investigation from multiple perspectives. How should number crunchers speak to qualitative analysts, or critical theorists engage with advocates of game theory and rational choice? How should inductive, evidence-based, and practice-oriented scholarship find common ground with principled approaches that draw authority from historical texts and frameworks that have little bearing on the issues of the present? Is integration possible and desirable, as in behav ioral science or area studies (see Klein, this volume), or are exchange and bridge-building the only realistic alternatives? And who decides when and by what criteria participants in an interdisciplinary venture have made sufficient contributions to the purposes of the academy to merit their own charter of independence? </p>
<p>Science and technology studies has encountered all of these problems, and to some extent </p>
<p>coped with them, but in a context that makes the field&#39;s challenges larger and more conse quential than those of interdisciplinarity more generally. For what is at stake in the success of STS is the underlying self-understanding of the disciplines themselves as coherent and unified entities. By contesting such dominant understandings, as a field with epistemology as its primary focus <em>must</em> do, STS enters into troubled and uncertain territory. In the terms sketched here, the  future  of  STS  depends  on  redrawing  the  map  of  the  disciplines  to  demon strate  that  they  are  all  islands  of happenstance, with unmapped waters between; STS then can claim a space for itself as another fertile territory in these wide waters, offering resources for understanding some of humanity&#39;s most impressive accomplishments, but without threatening anything achieved, or yet to be achieved, in other quarters of the disciplinary archipelago. What is needed to make this case, first and foremost, is an abiding conviction </p>
