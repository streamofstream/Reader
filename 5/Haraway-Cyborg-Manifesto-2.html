<p>A MANIFESTO FOR CYBORGS: SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND SOCIALIST FEMINISM IN THE 1980s</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AN IRONIC DREAM OF A COMMON LANGUAGE FOR WOMEN IN THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT </p>
<p>This essay is an effort to build an ironic political myth faithful to fem­ inism, socialism, and materialism. Perhaps more faithful as blasphemy is faithful, than as reverent worship and identification. Blasphemy has always seemed to require taking things very seriously. I know no better stance to adopt from within the secular-religious, evangelical traditions of United States politics, including the politics of socialist-feminism. Blasphemy protects one from the moral majority within, while still in­ sisting on the need for community. Blasphemy is not apostasy. Irony is about contradictions that do not resolve into larger wholes, even dialecti­ cally, about the tension of holding incompatible things together because both or all are necessary and true. Irony is about humor and serious play. It is also a rhetorical strategy and a political method, one I would like to see more honored within socialist feminism. At the center of my ironic faith, my blasphemy, is the image of the cyborg.</p>
<p>A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organ­ ism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction. Social reality is lived social relations, our most important political construc­ tion, a world-changing fiction. The international women&#39;s movements have constructed &quot;women&#39;s experience:&#39; as well as uncovered or discov­ ered this crucial collective object. This experience is a fiction and fact of the most crucial, political kind. Liberation rests on the construction</p>
<p>8  •   A Manifesto for Cyborgs</p>
<p>of the consciousness, the imaginative apprehension, of oppression, and so of possibility. The cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women&#39;s experience in the late twentieth century. This is a struggle over life and death, but the boundary between science fiction and social reality is an optical illusion.</p>
<p>Contemporary science fiction is full of cyborgs-creatures simulta­ neously animal and machine, who populate worlds ambiguously natural and crafted. Modern medicine is also full of cyborgs, of couplings be­ tween organism and machine, each conceived as coded devices, in an intimacy and with a power that was not generated in the history of sex­ uality. Cyborg &quot;sex&quot; restores some of the lovely replicative baroque of ferns and invertebrates (such nice organic prophylactics against hetero­ sexism). Cyborg replication is uncoupled from organic reproduction. Modern production seems like a dream of cyborg colonization of work, a dream that makes the nightmare ofTaylorism seem idyllic. And modern war is a cyborg orgy, coded by C31, command-control-communication­ intelligence, an $84 billion item in 1984&#39;s U.S. defense budget. I am making an argument for the cyborg as a fiction mapping our social and bodily reality and as an imaginative resource suggesting some very fruit­ ful couplings. Foucault&#39;s biopolitics is a flaccid premonition of cyborg politics, a very open field.</p>
<p>By the latetwentieth century, our time, a mythic time, we are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism; in short, we are cyborgs. The cyborg is our ontology; it gives us our politics. The cy­ borg is a condensed image of both imagination and material reality, the two joined centers structuring any possibility of historical transforma­ tion. In the traditions of &quot;Western&quot; science and politics-the tradition of racist, male-dominant capitalism; the tradition of progress; the tra­ dition of the appropriation of nature as resource for the productions of culture; the tradition of reproduction of the self from the reflections of the other-the relation between organism and machine has been a border war. The stakes in the border war have been the territories of production, reproduction, and imagination. This essay is an argument for <em>pleasure</em> in the confusion of boundaries and for <em>responsibility</em> in their construction. It is also an effort to contribute to socialist-feminist culture</p>
<p>and theory in a post-modernist, non-naturalist mode and in the utopian tradition of imagining a world without gender, which is perhaps a world without genesis, but maybe al�o a world without end. The cyborg incar­ nation is outside salvation history. Nor does the cyborg mark time on an Oedipal calendar, attempting to heal the terrible cleavages of gender in an oral-symbiotic utopia or post-oedipal apocalypse. As Zoe Sofoulis</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>argues in her unpublished manuscript on Jacques Lacan and Melanie Klein, <em>Lacklein,</em> the most terrible and perhaps the most promising mon­ sters in cyborg worlds are embodied in non-oedipal narratives with a different unconscious and a different logic of repression, which we need to understand for our survival.</p>
<p>The cyborg is a creature in a post -gender world; it has no truck with hi­ sexuality, pre-Oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labor, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all the powers of the parts into a higher unity. In a sense, the cyborg has no origin story in the Western sense; a &quot;final&quot; irony since the cyborg is also the awful apocalyptic <em>telos</em> of the &quot;West&#39;s&quot; escalating dominations of abstract indi­ viduation, an ultimate self untied at last from all dependency, a man in space. An origin story in the &quot;Western:&#39; humanist sense depends on the myth of original unity, fullness, bliss and terror, represented by the phal­ lic mother from whom all humans must separate, the task of individual development and of history, the twin potent myths inscribed most pow­ erfully for us in psychoanalysis and Marxism. Hilary Klein has argued that both Marxism and psychoanalysis, in their concepts of labor and of individuation and gender formation, depend on the plot of original unity out ofwhich difference must be produced and enlisted in a drama of escalating domination of woman/nature. The cyborg skips the step of original unity, of identification with nature in the Western sense. This is its illegitimate promise that might lead to subversion of its teleology as star wars.</p>
<p>The cyborg is resolutely committed to partiality, irony, intimacy, and perversity. It is oppositional, utopian, and completelywithout innocence. No longer structured by the polarity ofpublic and&#39;private, the cyborg de­ fines a technological polis based partly on a revolution of social relations in the <em>oikos,</em> the household. Nature and culture are reworked; the one can no longer be the resource for appropriation or incorporation by the other. The relationships for forming wholes from parts, including those of polarity and hierarchical domination, are at issue in the cyborg world. Unlike the hopes of Frankenstein&#39;s monster, the cyborg does not expect its father to save it through a restoration of the garden; i.e., through the fabrication of a heterosexual mate, through its completion in a finished whole, a city and cosmos. The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the Oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust. Perhaps that is why I want to see if cyborgs can subvert the apocalypse of returning to nuclear dust in the manic compulsion to name the Enemy. Cyboigs are not reverent; they do not remember the cosmos. They are wary of holism, but needy</p>
<p>for connection-they seem to have a natural feel for united front pol­ itics, but without the vanguard party. The main trouble with cyborgs, of course, is that they are the illegitimate offspring of militarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their fathers, after all, are inessential.</p>
<p>I will return to the science fiction of cyborgs at the end of this essay, but now I want to signal three crucial boundary breakdowns that make the following political fictional (political scientific) analysis possible. By the late twentieth century in United States scientific culture, the boundary between human and animal is thoroughly breached. The last beach­ heads of uniqueness have been polluted if not turned into amusement parks-language, tool use, social behavior, mental events, nothing really convincingly settles the separation ofhuman and animal. And many peo­ ple no longer feel the need of such a separation; indeed, many branches of feminist culture affirm the pleasure ofconnection ofhuman and other living creatures. Movements for animal rights are not irrational denials of human uniqueness; they are dear-sighted recognition of connection across the discredited breach of nature and culture. Biology and evolu­ tionary theory over the last two centuries have simultaneously produced modern organisms as objects ofknowledge and reduced the line between humans and animals to a faint trace re-etched in ideological struggle or professional disputes between life and social sciences. Within this frame­ work, teaching modern Christian creationism should be fought as a form of child abuse.</p>
<p>Biological-determinist ideology is only one position opened up in sci­</p>
<p>entific culture for arguing the meanings of human animality. There is much room for radical political people to contest for the meanings of the breached boundary. 1  The cyborg appears in myth precisely where the boundary between human and animal is transgressed. Far from sig­ naling a walling off of people from other living beings, cyborgs signal disturbingly and pleasurably tight coupling. Bestiality has a new status in this cycle of marriage exchange.</p>
<p>The second leaky distinction is between animal-human (organism) and machine. Pre-cybernetic machines could be haunted; there was al­ ways the specter of the ghost in the machine. This dualism structured the dialogue between materialism and idealism that was settled by a di­ alectical progeny, called spir�t or history, according to taste. But basically machines were not self-moving, self-designing, autonomous. They could not achieve man&#39;s dream,. only mock it. They were not man! an author to himself, but only a caricature of that masculinist reproductive dream.</p>
<p>To think they were otherwise was paranoid. Now we are not so sure. Late-twentieth-century machines have made thoroughly ambiguous the difference between natural and artificial, mind and body, self-developing and externally designed, and many other distinctions that used to apply to organisms and machines. Our machines are disturbingly lively, and we ourselves frighteningly inert.</p>
<p>Technological determinism is only one ideological space opened up by the reconceptions of machine and organism as coded texts through which we engage in the play of writing and reading the world. 2 &quot;Textu­ alization&quot; of everything in post -structuralist, post-modernist theory has been damned by Marxists and socialist feminists for its utopian disre­ gard for lived relations ofdomination that ground the &quot;play&quot; ofarbitrary reading.3• It is certainly true that post-modernist strategies, like my cy­ borg myth, subvert myriad organic wholes (e.g., the poem, the primitive culture, the biological organism). In short, the certainty of what counts as nature-a source of insight and a promise of innocence-is under­ mined, probably fatally. The transcendent authorization of interpreta­ tion is lost, and with it the ontology grounding &quot;Western&quot; epistemology. But the alternative is not cynicism or faithlessness, i.e., some version of abstract existence, like the accounts of technological determinism de­ stroying &quot;man&quot; by the &quot;machine&quot; or &quot;meaningful political action&quot; by the &quot;text:&#39; Who cyborgs will be is a radical question; the answers are a matter of surv ival. Both chimpanzees and artifacts have politics, so why shouldn&#39;t we?4</p>
<p>The third distinction is a subset of the second: the boundary between physical and non-physical is very imprecise for us. Pop physics books on</p>
<ul>
<li>A provocative, comprehensive argument about the politics and theories of &quot;post-modernism&quot; is made by Frederick jameson, who argues that post-modernism is not an option, a style among others, but a cultural dominant requiring radical reinvention of left politics from within; there is no longer any place from without that gives meaning to the comforting fiction of critical distance. jameson also makes clear why one cannot be for or against post-modernism, an essentially moralist move. My position is that feminists (and others) need continuous cultural reinvention, post-modernist critique, and historical materialism; only a cyborg would have a chance. The old dominations of white capitalist patriarchy seem nostalgically innocent now: they normalized heterogeneity, e.g., into man and woman, white and black. &quot;Advanced capitalism&quot; and post-modernism release heterogeneity without a norm, and we are flattened, without subjectivity, which requires depth, even unfriendly and drowning depths. It is time to write <em>The Death ofthe Clinic.</em> The clinic&#39;s methods required bodies and works; we have texts and surfaces. Our dominations don&#39;t work by medicalization and normalization anymore; they work by networking, communications redesign, stress management. Normalization gives way to automation, utter redundancy. Michel Foucault&#39;s <em>Birth ofthe Clinic, History of Sexuality,</em> and <em>Discipline and Punish</em> name a form of power at its moment of implosion. The discourse of biopolitics gives way to technobabble, the language of the spliced substantive; no noun is left whole  by the multinationals. These  are their names,  listed from one issue of <em>Science:</em> Tech-Knowledge, Genentech, Allergen, Hybritech, Compupto, Genen-cor, Syntex, Allelix,</li>

<p>Agrigenetics Corp., Syntro, Codon, Repligen, Micro-Angelo from Scion Corp., Percom Data, Inter Systems, Cyborg Corp., Statcom Corp., lntertec. If we are imprisoned by language, then escape from that prison house requires language poets, a kind of cultural restriction enzyme to cut the code; cyborg heteroglossia is one form of radical culture politics.</p>
<p>the consequences of quantum theory and the indeterminacy principle are a kind of popular scientific equivalent to the Harlequin romances as a marker of radical change in American white heterosexuality: they get it wrong, but they are on the right subject. Modern machines are quintessentially microelectronic devices: they are everywhere and they are invisible. Modern machinery is an irreverent upstart god, mocking the Father&#39;s ubiquity and spirituality. The silicon chip is a surface for writing; it is etched in molecular scales disturbed only by atomic noise, the ultimate interference for nuclear scores. Writing, power, and technol­ ogy are old partners in Western stories of the origin of civilization, but miniaturization has changed our experience of mechanism. Miniatur­ ization has turned out to be about power; small is not so much beautiful as pre-eminently dangerous, as in cruise missiles. Contrast the TV sets of the 1950s or the news cameras of the 1970s with the TV wrist bands or hand-sized video cameras now advertised. Our best machines are made of sunshine; they are all light and clean because they are nothing but signals, electromagnetic waves, a section of a spectrum. And these machines are eminently portable, mobile-a matter of immense human pain in Detroit and Singapore. People are nowhere near so fluid, being both material and opaque. Cyborgs are ether, quintessence.</p>
<p>The ubiquity and invisibility of cyborgs is precisely why these</p>
<p>sunshine-belt machines are so deadly. They are as hard to see politically as materially. Th�y are about consciousness-or its simulation. 5 They are floating signifiers moving in pickup trucks across Europe, blocked more effectively by the witch-weavings ofthe displaced and so unnatural Greenham women, who read the cyborg webs of power very well, than by the militant labor of older masculinist politics, whose natural con­ stituency needs defense jobs. Ultimately the &quot;hardest&quot; science is about the realm of greatest boundary confusion, the realm of pure number, pure spirit, C31, cryptography, and the preservation of potent secrets. The new machines are so clean and light. Their engineers are sun-worshipers mediating a new scientific revolution associated with the night dream of post-industrial society. The diseases evoked by these clean machines are &quot;no more&quot; than the miniscule coding changes of an antigen iri the im­ mune system, &quot;no more&quot; than the experience of stress. The nimble little fingers of &quot;Oriental&quot; women, the old fascination of little Anglo-Saxon Victorian girls with doll houses, women&#39;s enforced attention to the small t?·ke on quite new dimensions in this world. There might be a cyborg Alice taking account ofthese new dimensions. Ironically, it might be the unnat­ ural cyborg women making chips in Asia and spiral dancing in Santa Rita whose constructed unities will guide effective oppositional strategies.</p>
<p>So my cyborg myth is about transgressed boundaries, potent fusions, and dangerous possibilities which progressive people might explore as</p>
<p>one part of needed political work. One of my premises is that most American socialists and feminists see deepened dualisms of mind and body, animal and machine, idealism and materialism in the social practices, symbolic formulations, and physical artifacts   associated with &quot;high technology&quot; and scientific culture. From <em>One-Dimensional Man</em> to <em>The Death of Nature,</em>6 the analytic resources developed by progressives have insisted on the necessary domination of technics and recalled us to an imagined organic body to integrate our resistance. Another of my premises is that the need for unity of people trying to resist worldwide intensification of domination has never been more acute. But a slightly perverse shift of perspective might better enable us to contest for meanings, as well as for other forms of power and pleasure in technologically mediated societies.</p>
<p>From one perspective, a cyborg world is about the final imposition of a grid of control on the planet, about the final abstraction embodied in a Star War apocalypse waged in the name of defense, about the final appro­ priation of women&#39;s bodies in a masculinist orgy of war? From another perspective, a cyborg world might be about lived social and bodily reali­ ties in which people are not afraid oftheir joint kinship with animals and machines, not afraid ofpermanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints. The political struggle is to see from both perspectives at once because each reveals both dominations and possibilities unimagin­ able from the other vantage point. Single vision produces worse illusions than double vision or many-headed monsters. Cyborg unities are mon­ strous and illegitimate; in our present political circumstances, we could hardly hope for more potent myths for resistance and recoupling. I like to imagine LAG, the Livermore Action Group, as a kind of cyborg society dedicated to realistically converting the laboratories that most fiercely embody and spew out the tools of technological apocalypse, and com­ mitted to building a political form that actually manages to hold together witches, engineers, elders, perverts, Christians, mothers, and Leninists long&quot; enough to disarm the state. Fission Impossible is the name of the affi.Q.ity group in my town.  (Affinity: related not by blood but by choice, the appeal of one chemical nuclear group for another, avidity.)</p>
<p>FRACTURED IDENTITI ES </p>
<p>It has become difficult to name one&#39;s feminism by a single adjective­ or even to insist in every circumstance upon the noun. Consciousness of exclusion through naming is acute. Identities seem contradictory, partial, and strategic. With the hard-won recognition of their social and historical constitution, gender, race, and class cannot provide the basis</p>
<p>for belief in &quot;essential&quot; unity. There is nothing about being &quot;female&quot; that naturally binds women. There is not even such a state as &quot;being&quot; female, itself a highly complex category constructed in contested sexual scientific discourses and other social practices. Gender, race, or class consciousness is an achievement forced on us by the terrible historical experience of the contradictory social realities of patriarchy, colonialism, and capitalism. And who counts as &quot;us&quot; in my own rhetoric? Which identities are available to ground such a potent political myth called &quot;us:&#39; and what could motivate enlistment in this collectivity? Painful fragmentation among feminists (not to mention among women) along every possible fault line has made the concept of woman  elusive, an excuse for the matrix of women&#39;s dominations of each other. For me­ and for manywho share a similar historical location in white, professional middle class, female, radical, North American, mid-adult bodies-the sources of a crisis in political identity are legion. The recent history for much of the U.S. left and U.S. feminism has been a response to this kind of crisis by endless splitting and searches for a new essential unity. But there has also been a growing recognition of another response through coalition-affinity, not identity. 8</p>
<p>Chela Sandoval, from a consideration of specific historical moments in the formation of the new political voice called women of color, has theorized a hopeful model of political identity called &quot;oppositional con­ sciousness;&#39; born of the skills for reading webs of power by those refused stable membership in the social categories ofrace, sex, or class. 9 &quot;Women ofcolor;&#39; a name contested at its origins by those whom it would incorpo­ rate, as well as a historical consciousness marking systematic breakdown of all the signs of Man in &quot;Western&quot; traditions, constructs a kind of post­ modernist identity out ofotherness and difference. This post-modernist identity is fully political, whatever might be said about other possible post-modernisms.</p>
<p>Sandoval emphasizes the lack ofany essential criterion for identifying who is a woman of color. She notes that the definition of the group has been by conscious appropriation of negation. For example, a Chicana or U.S. black woman has not been able to speak as a woman or as a black person or as a Chicano. Thus, she was at the bottom of a cascade of negative identities, left out of even the privileged oppressed authorial categories called &quot;women and blacks,&quot; who claimed to make the impor­ tant revolutions. The category &quot;woman&quot; negated all non-white women; &quot;black&quot;  negated all non-bl11ck people,  as well as all black women.  But there was also no &quot;she;&#39; no singularity, but a sea of differences among</p>
<p>U. S. women who have affirmed their historical identity as U. S. women</p>
<p>of color. This identity marks out a self-consciously constr�cted space</p>
<p>that cannot affirm the capacity to act on the basis of natural identifica­ tion, but only on the basis of conscious coalition, of affinity, of political kinship. 10 Unlike the &quot;woman&quot; of some streams of the white women&#39;s movement in the United States, there is no naturalization of the matrix, or at least this is what Sandoval argues is uniquely available through the power of oppositional consciousness.</p>
<p>Sandoval&#39;s argument has to be seen as one potent formulation for feminists out ofthe worldwide development ofanti-colonialist discourse, i.e., discourse dissolving the &quot;West&quot; and its highest product-the one who is not animal, barbarian, or woman; i.e., man, the author of a cosmos called history. As orientalism is deconstructed politically and semiotically, the identities of the occident destabilize, including those of feminists. 11 Sandoval arguesthat &quot;women ofcolor&quot; have a chance to build an effective unity that does not replicate the imperializing, totalizing revolutionary subjects of previous Marxisms and feminisms which had not faced the consequences of the disorderly polyphony emerging from decolonization.</p>
<p>Katie King has emphasized the limits of identification and the po­ litical/poetic mechanics of identification built into reading &quot;the poem;&#39; that generative core of cultural feminism. King criticizes the persistent tendency among contemporary feminists from different &quot;moments&quot; or &quot;conversations&quot; in feminist practice to taxonomize the women&#39;s move­ ment to make one&#39;s own political tendencies appear to be the <em>telos</em> of the whole. These taxonomies tend to remake feminist history to appear to be an ideological struggle among coherent types persisting over time, es­ pecially those typical units called radical, liberal, and socialist feminism. Literally, all other feminisms are either incorporated or marginalized, usually by building an explicit ontology and epistemology. 12 Taxonomies of feminism produce epistemologies to police deviation from official women&#39;s experience. And of course, &quot;women&#39;s culture;&#39; like women of color, is consciously created by mechanisms inducing affinity. The ritu­ als of poetry, music, and certain forms of academic practice have been pre-eminent. The politics of race and culture in the U.S. women&#39;s move­ ments are intimately interwoven. The common achievement of King and Sandoval is learning how to craft a poetic/political unity without relying on a logic ofappropriation, incorporation, and taxonomic identification.</p>
<p>The theoretical and practical struggle against unity-through-domination or unity-through- incorporation ironically not only undermines the jus­ tifications for patriarchy, colonialism, humanism, positivism, essen­ tialism, scientism, and other unlamented -isms, but <em>all</em> claims for an organic or natural standpoint. I think that radical and socialist/Marxist</p>
<p>feminisms have also undermined their/our own epistemological strate­ gies and that this is a crucially valuable step in imagining possible unities. It remains to be seen whether all &quot;epistemologies&quot; as Western political people have known them fail us in the task to build effective affinities.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the effort to construct revolutionary stand­ points, epistemologies as achievements ofpeople committed to changing the world, has been part of the process showing the limits of identifica­ tion. The acid tools of post-modernist theory and the constructive tools of ontological discourse about revolutionary subjects might be seen as ironic allies in dissolving Western selves in the interests of survival. We are excruciatingly conscious of what it means to have a historically con­ stituted body. But with the loss of innocence in our origin, there is no expulsion from the Garden either. Our politics lose the indulgence ofguilt with the na&quot;ivete ofinnocence. But what would another political myth for socialist feminism look like? What kind of politics could embrace par­ tial, contradictory, permanently unclosed constructions of personal and collective selves and still be faithful, effective-and, ironically, socialist feminist?</p>
<p>I do not know of any other time in history when there was greater need for political unity to confront effectively the dominations of &quot;race;&#39; &quot;gender;&#39; &quot;sexuality;&#39; and &quot;class.&quot; I also do not know of any other time when the kind of unity we might help build could have been possible. None of &quot;us&quot; have any longer the symbolic or material capability of dic­ tating the shape of reality to any of &quot;them:&#39; Or at least &quot;we&quot; cannot claim innocence from practicing such dominations. White women, including socialist feminists, discovered (i.e., were forced kicking and screaming to notice) the non-innocence ofthe category &quot;woman.&quot; That consciousness changes the geography of all previous categories; it denatures them as heat denatures a fragile protein. Cyborg feminists have to argue that &quot;we&quot; do not want any more natural matrix of unity and that no construction is whole. Innocence, and the corollary insistence on victimhood as the only ground for insight, has done enough damage. But the constructed revolutionary subject must give late-twentieth-century people pause as well. In the fraying of identities and in the reflexive strategies for con­ structing them, the possibility opens up for weaving something other than a shroud for the day after the apocalypse that so prophetically ends salvation history.</p>
<p>Both Marxist/socialist feminisms and radical feminisms have simul­ taneously naturalized and qenatured the category &quot;woman&quot; and con­ sciousness ofthe social lives of &quot;women.&quot; Perhaps a schematic caricature can highlight both kinds of moves. Marxian socialism is ro_oted in an</p>
<p>analysis of wage labor which reveals class structure. The consequence of the wage relationship is systematic alienation, as the worker is dissoci­ ated from his <em>[sic]</em> product. Abstraction and illusion rule in knowledge, domination rules in practice. Labor is the pre-eminently privileged cat­ egory enabling the Marxist to overcome illusion and find that point of view which is necessary for changing the world. Labor is the humaniz­ ing activity that makes man; labor is an ontological category permitting the knowledge of a subject, and so the knowledge of subjugation and alienation.</p>
<p>In faithful filiation, socialist feminism advanced by allying itself with the basic analytic strategies of Marxism. The main achievement ofboth Marxist feminists and socialist feminists was to expand the category of labor to accommodate what (some) women did, even when the wage relation was subordinated to a more comprehensive view oflabor under capitalist patriarchy. In particular, women&#39;s labor in the household and women&#39;s activity as mothers generally, i.e., reproduction in the socialist feminist sense, entered theory on the authority ofanalogy to the Marxian concept oflabor. The unity ofwomen here rests on an epistemology based on the ontological structure of &quot;labor.&quot; Marxist/socialist feminism does not &quot;naturalize&quot; unity; it is a possible achievement based on a possible standpoint rooted in social relations. The essentializing move is in the ontological structure oflabor or ofits analogue, women&#39;s activity. 1 3&#39; The inheritance of Marxian humanism, with its pre-eminently Western self, is the difficulty for me. The contribution from these formulations has been the emphasis on the daily responsibility of real women to build unities, rather than to naturalize them.</p>
<p>Catharine MacKinnon&#39;s version of radical feminism is itself a caricature of the appropriating, incorporating, totalizing tendencies of Western theories of identity grounding action. 14 It is factually and politically wrong to assimilate all of the diverse &quot;moments&quot; or &quot;conversations&quot; in recent women&#39;s politics named radical feminism to MacKinnon&#39;s version. But the teleological logic of her theory shows how an epistemology and ontology-including their negations-erase or police difference. Only one of the effects of MacKinnon&#39;s theory is the rewriting of the history of the polymorphous field called radical feminism. The major effect</p>
<p>· The central role of object-relations versions of psychoanalysis and related strong universalizing moves in dis­ cussing reproduction, caring work, and mothering in many approaches to epistemology underline their authors&#39; resistance to what I am calling post-modernism. For me, both the universalizing moves and the versions of psy­ choanalysis make analysis of&quot;women&#39;s place in the integrated circuit&quot; difficult and lead to systematic difficulties in accounting for or even seeing major aspects of the construction of gender and gendered social life.</p>
<p>is the production of a theory of experience, of women&#39;s identity, that is a kind of apocalypse for all revolutionary standpoints. That is, the totalization  built  into  this  tale  of radical  feminism  achieves its  end­ the unity of women-by enforcing the experience of and testimony to radical non-being. As for the Marxist/socialist feminist, consciousness is an achievement, not a natural fact. And MacKinnon&#39;s theory eliminates some of the difficulties built into humanist revolutionary subjects, but at the cost of radical reductionism.</p>
<p>MacKinnon argues that radical feminism necessarily adopted a differ­ ent analytical strategy from Marxism, looking first not at the structure of class, but at the structure of sex/gender and its generative relation­ ship, men&#39;s constitution and appropriation of women sexually. Iron­ ically, MacKinnon&#39;s &quot;ontology&quot; constructs a non-subject, a non-being. Another&#39;s desire, not the self&#39;s labor, is the origin of&quot;woman:&#39; She there­ fore develops a theory of consciousness that enforces what can count as &quot;women&#39;s&quot; experience-anything that names sexual violation, indeed, sex itself as far as &quot;women&quot; can be concerned. Feminist practice is the construction of this form of consciousness; i.e., the self-knowledge of a self-who-is-not.</p>
<p>Perversely, sexual appropriation in this radical feminism still has the epistemological status oflabor, i.e., the point from which analysis able to contribute to changing the world must flow. But sexual objectification, not alienation, is the consequence of the structure of sex/gender. In the realm of knowledge, the result of sexual objectification is illusion and abstraction. However, a woman is not simply alienated from her product, but in a deep sense does not exist as a subject, or even potential subject, since she owes her existence as a woman to sexual appropriation. To be constituted by another&#39;s desire is not the same thing as to be alienated in the violent separation of the laborer from his product.</p>
<p>MacKinnon&#39;s radical theory of experience is totalizing in the ex­ treme; it does not so much marginalize as obliterate the authority of any other women&#39;s political speech and action. It is a totalization producing what Western patriarchy itselfnever succeeded in doing-feminists&#39; con­ sciousness of the non-existence of women, except as products of men&#39;s desire. I think MacKinnon correctly argues that no Marxian version of identity can firmly ground women&#39;s unity. But in solving the problem of the contradictions ofany Western revolutionary subject for feminist pur­ poses, she develops an even more authoritarian doctrine ofexperience. If my complaint about socialist/Marxian standpoints is their uni ended erasure of polyvocal; unassimilable, radical difference made vi &quot;ble in anti-colonial discourse and practice, MacKinnon&#39;s intentiqnal e sure</p>
<p>of all difference through the device of the &quot;essential&quot; non-existence of women is not reassuring.</p>
<p>In my taxonomy, which like any other taxonomy is a reinscription of history, radical feminism can accommodate all the activities of women named by socialist feminists as forms of labor only if the activity can somehow be sexualized. Reproduction had different tones of meanings for the two tendencies, one rooted in labor, one in sex, both calling the consequences ofdomination and ignorance ofsocial and personal reality &quot;false consciousness.&quot;</p>
<p>Beyond either the difficulties or the contributions in the argument of any one author, neither Marxist nor radical feminist points of view have tended to embrace the status of a partial explanation; both were regularly constituted as totalities. Western explanation has demanded as much; how else could the &quot;Western&quot; author incorporate its others? Each tried to annex other forms of domination by expanding its basic cate­ gories through analogy, simple listing, or addition. Embarrassed silence about race among white radical and socialist feminists was one major, devastating political consequence. History and polyvocality disappear into political taxonomies that try to establish genealogies. There was no structural room for race (or for much else) in theory claiming to reveal the construction of the category woman and social group women as a unified or totalizable whole. The structure of my caricature looks like this:</p>
<p>Socialist Feminism-</p>
<p>structure of class//wage labor//alienation</p>
<p>labor, by analogy reproduction, by extension sex, by addition race</p>
<p>Radical Feminism-</p>
<p>structure  of gender//sexual  appropriation//objectification</p>
<p>sex, by analogy labor, by extension reproduction, by addition race</p>
<p>In another context, the French theorist Julia Kristeva claimed women appeared as a historical group after World War II, along with groups like youth. Her dates are doubtful; but we are now accustomed to remem­ bering that as objects of knowledge and as historical actors, &quot;race&quot; did not always exist, &quot;class&quot; has a historical genesis, and &quot;homosexuals&quot; are quite junior. It is no accident that the symbolic system of the family of man-and so the essence ofwoman-breaks up at the same moment that networks ofconnection among people on the planet are unprecedentedly multiple, pregnant, and complex. &#39;&#39;Advanced capitalism&quot; is inadequate to convey the structure of this historical moment. In the &quot;Western&quot; sense,</p>
<p>the end of man is at stake. It is no accident that woman disintegrates into women in our time. Perhaps socialist feminists were not substantially guilty of producing essentialist theory that suppressed women&#39;s particu­ larity and contradictory interests. I think we have been, at least through unreflective participation in the logics, languages, and practices ofwhite humanism and through searching for a single ground of domination to secure our revolutionary voice. Now we have less excuse. But in the consciousness of our failures, we risk lapsing into boundless difference and giving up on the confusing task of making partial, real connection. Some differences are playful; some are poles of world historical systems of domination. &quot;Epistemology&quot; is about knowing the difference.</p>
<p>THE IN FORMATICS OF DOMI NATION </p>
<p>In this attempt at an epistemological and political position, I would like to sketch a picture of possible unity, a picture indebted to socialist and feminist principles of design. The frame for my sketch is set by the extent and importance of rearrangements in worldwide social relations tied to science and technology. I argue for a politics rooted in claims about fundamental changes in the nature of class, race, and gender in an emerging system ofworld order analogous in its novelty and scope to that created by industrial capitalism; we are living through a movement from an organic, industrial society to a polymorphous, information system­ from all work to all play, a deadly game. Simultaneously material and ideological, the dichotomies may be expressed in the following chart of transitions from the comfortable old hierarchical dominations to the scary new networks I have called the informatics of domination:</p>

<p>Informatics of Domination</p>
<p>This list suggests several interesting things. 1 5 First, the objects on the right-hand side cannot be coded as &quot;natural:&#39; a realization that sub­ verts naturalistic coding for the left-hand side as well. We cannot go back ideologically or materially. It&#39;s not just that &quot;god&quot; is dead; so is the &quot;goddess.&quot; In relation to objects like biotic components, one must think not in terms of essential properties, but in terms of strategies of design, boundary constraints, rates of flows, systems logics, costs of lowering constraints. Sexual reproduction is one kind of reproductive strategy among many, with costs and benefits as a function of the system envi­ ronment. Ideologies ofsexual reproduction can no longer reasonably call on the notions of sex and sex role as organic aspects in natural objects like organisms and families. Such reasoning will be unmasked as irra­ tional, and ironically corporate executives reading <em>Playboy</em> and anti-porn radical feminists will make strange bedfellows in jointly unmasking the</p>
<p>Likewise for race, ideologies about human diversity have to be for­ mulated in terms of frequencies of parameters, like blood groups or intelligence scores. It is &quot;irrational&quot; to invoke concepts like primitive and civilized. For liberals and radicals, the search for integrated social systems gives way to a new practice called &quot;experimental ethnography&quot; in which an organic object dissipates in attention to the play ofwriting. At</p>
<p>the level of ideology, we see translations of racism and colonialism into languages of development and underdevelopment, rates and constraints of modernization. Any objects or persons can be reasonably thought of in terms of disassembly and reassembly; no &quot;natural&quot; architectures con­ strain system design. The financial districts in all the world&#39;s cities, as well as the export-processing and free-trade zones, proclaim this elementary fact of&quot;late capitalism.&quot; The entire universe of objects that can be known scientifically must be formulated as problems in communications engi­ neering ( for the managers) or theories of the text ( for those who would resist). Both are cyborg semiologies.</p>
<p>One should expect control strategies to concentrate on boundary con­ ditions and interfaces, on rates of flow across boundaries-and not on the integrity ofnatural objects. &quot;Integrity&quot; or &quot;sincerity&quot; of the Western self gives way to decision procedures and expert systems. For example, control strategies applied to women&#39;s capacities to give birth to new hu­ man beings will be developed in the languages ofpopulation control and maximization ofgoal achievement for individual decision-makers. Con­ trol strategies will be formulated in terms of rates, costs of constraints, degrees of freedom. Human beings, like any other component or sub­ system, must be localized in a system architecture whose basic modes of operation are probabilistic, statistical. No objects, spaces, or bodies are sacred in themselves; any component can be interfaced with any other if the proper standard, the proper code, can be constructed for processing signals in a common language. Exchange in this world transcends the universal translation effected by capitalist markets that Marx analyzed so well. The privileged pathology affecting all kinds of components in this universe is stress-communications breakdown. 16 The cyborg is not subject to Foucault&#39;s biopolitics; the cyborg simulates politics, a much more potent field of operations.</p>
<p>This kind of analysis of scientific and cultural objects of knowledge which have appeared historically since World War II prepares us to no­ tice some important inadequacies in · feminist analysis which has pro­ ceeded as ifthe organic, hierarchical d alisms ordering discourse in &quot;the West&quot; since Aristotle still ruled. They ave been cannibalized, or as Zoe Sofia (Sofoulis) might put it, they hav been &quot;techno-digested.&quot; The di­ chotomies between mind and body, animal and human, organism and machine, public and private, nature and culture, men and women, prim­ itive and civilized are all in question ideologically. The actual situation of</p>
<p>women is their integration/exploitation into a world system of produc­ tion/reproduction and communication called the informati.cs of domi­</p>
<p>nation. The home, workplace, market, public arena, the body itself-all</p>
<p>can be dispersed and interfaced in nearly infinite, polymorphous ways, with large consequences for women and others-consequences that themselves are very different for different people and which make potent oppositional international movements difficult to imagine and essential for survival. One important route for reconstructing socialist-feminist politics is through theory and practice addressed to the social relations of science and technology, including crucially the systems of myth and meanings structuring our imaginations. The cyborg is a kind of disas­ sembled and reassembled, post-modern collective and personal self. This is the self feminists must code.</p>
<p>Communications technologies and biotechnologies are the crucial tools recrafting our bodies. These tools embody and enforce new social relations for women worldwide. Technologies and scientific discourses can be partially understood as formalizations, i.e., as frozen moments, ofthe fluid social interactions constituting them, but they should also be viewed as instruments for enforcing meanings. The boundary is perme­ able between tool and myth, instrument and concept, historical systems of social relations and historical anatomies of possible bodies, including objects of knowledge. Indeed, myth and tool mutually constitute each other.</p>
<p>Furthermore, communications sciences and modern biologies are constructed  by  a  common  move-<em>the  translation  of the  world  into  a problem of coding,</em> a search for a common language in which all resis­ tance to instrumental control disappears and all heterogeneity can be submitted to disassembly, reassembly, investment, and exchange.</p>
<p>In communications sciences, the translation of the world into a prob­ lem in coding can be illustrated by looking at cybernetic ( feedback con­ trolled) systems theories applied to telephone technology, computer de­ sign, weapons deployment, or data base construction and maintenance. In each case, solution to the key questions rests on a theory of lan­ guage and control; the key operation is determining the rates, direc­ tions, and probabilities of flow of a quantity called information. The world is subdivided by boundaries differentially permeable to informa­ tion. Information is just that kind of quantifiable element (unit, basis of unity) which allows universal translation, and so unhindered instrumen­ tal power (called effective communication). The biggest threat to such power is interruption of communication. Any system breakdown is a function ofstress. The fundamentals ofthis technology can be condensed into the metaphor C31, command-control-communication-intelligence, the military&#39;s symbol for its operations theory.</p>
<p>In modern biologies, the translation of the world into a problem in coding can be illustrated by molecular genetics, ecology, socio-biological</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>lated into problems of genetic coding and read-out. Biotechnology, a writing technology, informs research broadly. 1 7 In a sense, organisms have ceased to exist as objects of knowledge, giving way to biotic com­ ponents, i.e., special kinds of information processing devices. The anal­</p>
<p>ogous moves in ecology could be examined by probing the history and utility of the concept of the ecosystem. Immunobiology and associated medical practices are rich exemplars ofthe privilege ofcoding and recog­ nition systems as objects ofknowledge, as constructions ofbodily reality for us. Biology is here a kind of cryptography. Research is necessarily a kind ofintelligence activity. Ironies abound. A stressed system goes awry; its communication processes break down; it fails to recognize the differ­ ence between self and other. Human babies with baboon hearts evoke national ethical perplexity-for animal-rights activists at least as much as for guardians of human purity. Gay men, Haitian immigrants, and intravenous drug users are the &quot;privileged&quot; victims ofan awful immune­ system disease that marks (inscribes on the body) confusion of bound­ aries and moral pollution.</p>
<p>But these excursions into communications sciences and biology have been at a rarefied level; there is a mundane, largely economic reality to support my claim that these sciences and technologies indicate funda­ mental transformations in the structure ofthe world for us. Communica­ tions technologies depend on electronics. Modern states, multinational corporations, military power, welfare-state apparatuses, satellite systems, political processes, fabrication of our imaginations, labor-control sys­ tems, medical constructions of our bodies, commercial pornography, the international division of labor, and religious evangelism depend intimately upon electronics. Microelectronics is the technical basis of simulacra, i.e., of copies without originals.</p>
<p>Microelectronics mediates the translations of <em>labor</em> into robotics and word processing; <em>sex</em> into genetic engineering and reproductive tech­ nologies; and <em>mind</em> into artificial intelligence and decision procedures.</p>
<p>The new biotechnologies concern mor   han human reproduction. Biol­</p>
<p>ogy as a powerful engineering science fo redesigning materials and pro­ cesses has revolutionary implications fori dustry, perhaps most obvious today in areas of fermentation, agricult re, and energy. Communica­ tions sciences and biology are constructions of natural-technical objects of knowledge in which the difference between machine and organism is thoroughly blurred; mind, .body, and tool are on very intimate terms. The &quot;multinational&quot; material organization ofthe production and repro­</p>
<p>duction  of daily life  and  the  symbolic organization  of the  p�oduction</p>
<p>and reproduction of culture and imagination seem equally implicated. The boundary-maintaining images of base and superstructure, public and private, or material and ideal never seemed more feeble.</p>
<p>I have used Rachel Grossman&#39;s image of women in the integrated cir­ cuit to name the situation ofwomen in a world so intimately restructured through the social relations of science and technology. 1 8 I use the odd circumlocution, &quot;the social relations of science and technology;&#39; to indi­ cate that we are not dealing with a technological determinism, but with a historical system depending upon structured relations among people. But the phrase should also indicate that science and technology provide fresh sources ofpower, that we need fresh sources ofanalysis and political action. 19 Some of the rearrangements of race, sex, and class rooted in high-tech-facilitated social relations can make socialist feminism more relevant to effective progressive politics.</p>
<p>THE HOMEWORK ECONOMY </p>
<p>The &quot;new industrial revolution&quot; is producing a new worldwide working class. The extreme mobility of capital and the emerging international division of labor are intertwined with the emergence of new collectivi­ ties, and the weakening of familiar groupings. These developments are neither gender- nor race-neutral. White men in advanced industrial so­ cieties have become newly vulnerable to permanent job loss, and women are not disappearing from the job rolls at the same rates as men. It is not simply that women in third-world countries are the preferred la­ bor force for the science-based multinationals in the export-processing sectors, particularly in electronics. The picture is more systematic and in­ valves reproduction, sexuality, culture, consumption, and production. In the prototypical Silicon Valley, many women&#39;s lives have been structured around employment in electronics-dependent jobs, and their intimate realities include serial heterosexual monogamy, negotiating childcare, distance from extended kin or most other forms of traditional commu­ nity, a high likelihood ofloneliness and extreme economic vulnerability as they age. The ethnic and racial diversity of women in Silicon Valley structures a microcosm of conflicting differences in culture, family, reli­ gion, education, language.</p>
<p>Richard Gordon has called this new situation the homework economy.20 Although he includes the phenomenon of literal home­ work emerging in connection with electronics assembly, Gordon intends &quot;homework economy&quot; to name a restructuring ofwork that broadly has the characteristics formerly ascribed to female jobs, jobs literally done</p>
<p>26  •   A Manifesto for Cyborgs</p>
<p>only by women. Work is being redefined as both literally female and fern­ inized, whether performed by men or women. To be feminized means to be made extremely vulnerable; able to be disassembled, reassembled, exploited as a reserve labor force; seen less as workers than as servers; subjected to time arrangements on and off the paid job that make a mockery of a limited work day; leading an existence that always borders on being obscene, out of place, and reducible to sex. Deskilling is an old strategy newly applicable to formerly privileged workers. However, the homework economy does not refer only to large-scale deskilling, nor does it deny that new areas of high skill are emerging, even for women and men previously excluded from skilled employment. Rather, the con­ cept indicates that factory, home, and market are integrated on a new scale and that the places of women are crucial-and need to be analyzed for differences among women and for meanings for relations between men and women in various situations.</p>
<p>The homework economy as a world capitalist organizational structure is made possible by (not caused by) the new technologies. The successs of the attack on relatively privileged, mostly white, men&#39;s unionized jobs is tied to the power ofthe new communications technologies to integrate and control labor despite extensive dispersion and decentralization. The consequences ofthe new technologies are felt by women both in the loss of the family (male) wage (ifthey ever had access to this white privilege) and in the character of their own jobs, which are becoming capital- intensive, e.g., office work and nursing.</p>
<p>The new economic and technological arrangements are also related to the collapsing welfare state and the ensuing intensification of demands on women to sustain daily life for themselves as well as for men, children, and old people. The feminization of poverty-generated by dismantling the welfare state, by the homework economy where stable jobs become the exception, and sustained by the expectation that women&#39;s wage will not be matched by a male income for the support of children-has be­ come an urgent focus. The causes ofvarious women-headed households are a function ofrace, class, or sexuality; but their increasing generality is a ground for coalitions ofwomen  many issues. That women regularly sustain daily life partly as a functi      of their enforced status as moth­ ers is hardly new; the kind of integr tion with the overall capitalist and progressively war-based economy is new. The particular pressure, for ex­ ample, on U.S. black women, who have achieved an escape from (barely) paid domestic service and �ho now hold clerical and similar jobs in large numbers, has large implications for continued enforced black poverty with employment. Teenage women in industrializing areas. of the third</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>world increasingly find themselves the sole or major source ofa cash wage for their families, while access to land is ever more problematic. These developments must have major consequences in the psychodynamics and politics of gender and race.</p>
<p>Within the framework of three major stages of capitalism ( commer­ cial/early industrial, monopoly, multinational)-tied to nationalism, imperialism, and multinationalism, and related to Jameson&#39;s three dom­ inant aesthetic periods of realism, modernism, and postmodernism-1 would argue that specific forms of families dialectically relate to forms of capital and to its political and cultural concomitants. Although lived problematically and unequally, ideal forms of these families might be schematized as (1) the patriarchal nuclear family, structured by the di­ chotomy between public and private and accompanied by the white bourgeois ideology of separate spheres and nineteenth-century Anglo­ American bourgeois feminism; ( 2) the modern family mediated (or en­ forced) by the welfare state and institutions like the family wage, with a flowering of afeminist heterosexual ideologies, including their radi­ cal versions represented in Greenwich Village around World War I; and ( 3) the &quot;family&quot; of the homework economy with its oxymoronic struc­ ture of women-headed households and its explosion of feminisms and the paradoxical intensification and erosion of gender itself.</p>
<p>This is the context in which the projections for worldwide structural unemployment stemming from the new technologies are part ofthe pic­ ture of the homework economy. As robotics and related technologies put men out of work in &quot;developed&quot; countries and exacerbate failure to generate male jobs in third-world &quot;development;&#39; and as the automated office becomes the rule even in labor-surplus countries, the feminiza­ tion of work intensifies. Black women in the United States have long known what it looks like to face the structural underemployment (&quot;fem­ inization&quot;) ofblack men, as well as their own highly vulnerable position in the wage economy. It is no longer a secret that sexuality, reproduc­ tion, family, and community life are interwoven with this economic structure in myriad ways which have also differentiated the situations of white and black women. Many more women and men will contend with similar situations, which will make cross-gender and race alliances on issues of basic life support (with or without jobs) necessary, not just nice.</p>
<p>The new technologies also have a profound effect on hunger and on food production for subsistence worldwide. Rae Lessor Blumberg esti­ mates that women produce about fifty per cent ofthe world&#39;s subsistence</p>
<p>28  •   A Manifesto for Cyborgs</p>
<p>food.21*  Women  are  excluded  generally  from  benefiting  from  the  in­ creased high-tech commodification of food and energy crops, their days are made more arduous because their responsibilities to provide food do not diminish, and their reproductive situations are made more complex. Green Revolution technologies interact with other high-tech industrial production to alter gender divisions oflabor and differential gender mi­ gration patterns:</p>
<p>The new technologies seem deeply involved in the forms of&quot;privatiza­ tion&quot; that Ros Petcheskyhas analyzed, in which militarization, right-wing family ideologies and policies, and intensified definitions of corporate property as private synergistically interact. 22 The new communications technologies are fundamental to the eradication of&quot;public life&quot; for every­ one. This facilitates the mushrooming ofa permanent high-tech military establishment at the cultural and economic expense of most people, but especially ofwomen. Technologies like video games and highly miniatur­ ized television seem crucial to production of modern forms of &quot;private life.&quot; The culture of video games is heavily oriented to individual com­ petition and extraterrestrial warfare. High-tech, gendered imaginations are produced here, imaginations that can contemplate destruction ofthe planet and a sci-fi escape from its consequences. More than our imag­ inations is militarized, and the other realities of electronic and nuclear warfare are inescapable.</p>
<p>The new technologies affect the social relations of both sexuality and reproduction, and not always in the same ways. The close ties of sex­ uality and instrumentality, of views of the body as a kind of private satisfaction- and utility-maximizing machine, are described nicely in sociobiological origin stories that stress a genetic calculus and explain the inevitable dialectic of domination of male and female gender roles. 23 These sociobiological stories depend on a high-tech view of the body as a biotic component or cybernetic communications system. Among the many transformations of reproductive situations is the medical one, where women&#39;s bodies have boundaries newly permeable to both &quot;visu­ alization&quot; and &quot;intervention.&quot; Ofcourse, who controls the interpretation of bodily boundaries in medical hermeneutics is a major feminist issue.

<p>1970s; that hand-craft tool is inadequate to express our needed body politics in the negotiation of reality in the practices of cyborg reproduc­ tion. Self-help is not enough. The technologies ofvisualization recall the important cultural practice of hunting with the camera and the deeply predatory nature of a photographic consciousness.24 Sex, sexuality, and reproduction are central actors in high-tech myth systems structuring our imaginations of personal and social possibility.</p>
<p>Another critical aspect of the social relations of the new technologies is the reformulation ofexpectations, culture, work, and reproduction for the large scientific and technical work force. A major social and political danger is the formation of a strongly bimodal social structure, with the masses of women and men of all ethnic groups, but especially people of color, confined to a homework economy, illiteracy of several vari­ eties, and general redundancy and impotence, controlled by high-tech repressive apparatuses ranging from entertainment to surveillance and disappearance. An adequate socialist-feminist politics should address women in the privileged occupational categories, and particularly in the production of science and technology that constructs scientific-technical discourses, processes, and objects.25</p>
<p>This issue is only one aspect of inquiry into the possibility of a fem­ inist science, but it is important. What kind of constitutive role in the production of knowledge, imagination, and practice can new groups doing science have? How can these groups be allied with progressive social and political movements? What kind of political accountability can be constructed to tie women together across the scientific-technical hierarchies separating us? Might there be ways of developing feminist science/technology politics in alliance with anti-military science facil­ ity conversion action groups? Many scientific and technical workers in Silicon Valley, the high-tech cowboys included, do not want to work on military science.26 Can these personal preferences and cultural tenden­ cies be welded into progressive politics among this professional middle class in which women, including women of color, are coming to be fairly numerous?</p>
<p>WOMEN IN THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT </p>
<p>Let me summarize the picture of women&#39;s historical locations in ad­ vanced industrial societies, as these positions have been restructured partly through the social relations of science and technology. If it was ever possible ideologically to characterize women&#39;s lives by the distinc­ tion of public and private domains-suggested by images ofthe division ofworking-class life into factory and home, ofbourgeois life into market</p>
<p>and home, and of gender existence into personal and political realms­ it is now a totally misleading ideology, even to show how both terms of these dichotomies construct each other in practice and in theory. I prefer a network ideological image, suggesting the profusion of spaces and identities and the permeability of boundaries in the personal body and in the body politic. &quot;Networking&quot; is both a feminist practice and a multinational corporate strategy-weaving is for oppositional cyborgs. The only way to characterize the informatics of domination is as a massive intensification of insecurity and cultural impoverishment, with common failure of subsistence networks for the most vulnerable. Since much of this picture interweaves with the social relations of science and technology, the urgency of a socialist-feminist politics addressed to science and technology is plain. There is much now being done, and the grounds for political work are rich. For example, the efforts to develop forms of collective struggle for women in paid work, like SEIU&#39;s District 925, should be a high priority for all of us. These efforts are profoundly tied to technical restructuring of labor processes and reformations of working classes. These efforts also are providing understanding of a more comprehensive kind of labor organization, involving community, sexuality, and family issues never privileged in the largely white male</p>
<p>industrial unions.</p>
<p>The structural rearrangements related to the social relations of sci­ ence and technology evoke strong ambivalence. But it is not necessary to be ultimately depressed by the implications oflate-twentieth-century women&#39;s relation to all aspects of work, culture, production of knowl­ edge, sexuality, and reproduction. For excellent reasons, most Marxisms see domination best and have trouble understanding what can only look like false consciousness and people&#39;s complicity in their own domination in late capitalism. It is crucial to remember that what is lost, perhaps espe­ cially from women&#39;s points ofview, is often virulent forms ofoppression, nostalgically naturalized in the face of current violation. Ambivalence toward the disrupted unities mediated by high-tech culture requires not sorting consciousness into categories of &quot;clear-sighted critique ground­</p>
<p>ing a solid political epistemology&quot; versus &quot;manipulated false conscious­ ness:&#39; but subtle understanding of e ·     rging pleasures, experiences, and</p>
<p>powers with serious potential for chan · ng the rules of the game.</p>
<p>There are grounds for hope in the e    erging bases for new kinds of unity across race, gender, and class, as these elementary units ofsocialist­ feminist analysis themselves s�ffer protean transformations. Intensifica­ tions of hardship experienced worldwide in connection with the so­ cial relations of science and· technology are severe. But what p�ople are experiencing is not transparently clear, and we lack sufficiently subtle</p>
<p>Science, Technology, and Socialist Feminism in the 1980s   •    31</p>
<p>connections for collectively building effective theories of experience. Present efforts-Marxist, psychoanalytic, feminist, anthropological-to clarify even &quot;our&quot; experience are rudimentary.</p>
<p>I am conscious of the odd perspective provided by my historical position-a Ph.D. in biology for an Irish Catholic girl was made possible by Sputnik&#39;s impact on U.S. national science-education policy. I have a body and mind as much constructed by the post-World War II arms race and Cold War as by the women&#39;s movements. There are more grounds for hope by focusing on the contradictory effects of politics designed to produce loyal American technocrats, which as well produced large numbers of dissidents, rather than by focusing on the present defeats.</p>
<p>The permanent partiality of feminist points ofview has consequences for our expectations of forms ofpolitical organization and participation. We do not need a totality in order to work well. The feminist dream of a common language, like all dreams for a perfectly true language, of perfectly faithful naming of experience, is a totalizing and imperialist one. In that sense, dialectics too is a dream language, longing to resolve contradiction. Perhaps, ironically, we can learn from our fusions with animals and machines how not to be Man, the embodiment of Western logos. From the point of view of pleasure in these potent and taboo fusions, made inevitable by the social relations ofscience and technology, there might indeed be a feminist science.</p>
<p>CYBORGS: A MYTH OF POLITICAL IDE NTITY</p>
<p>I want to conclude with a myth about identity and boundaries which might inform late-twentieth-century political imaginations. I am in­ debted in this story to writers like Joanna Russ, Samuel R. Delany, John Varley, James Tiptree, Jr., Octavia Butler, Monique Wittig, and Vonda Mcintyre. 27 These are our storytellers exploring what it means to be em­ bodied in high-tech worlds. They are theorists for cyborgs. Exploring conceptions of bodily boundaries and social order, the anthropologist Mary Douglas should be credited with helping us to consciousness about</p>
<p>how fundamental body imagery is to world view, and so to political language.28 French feminists like Luce Irigaray and Monique Wittig, for all their differences, know how to write the body, how to weave eroticism, cosmology, and politics from imagery of embodiment, and especially for Wittig, from imagery of fragmentation and reconstitution of bodies.29</p>
<p>American radical feminists like Susan Griffin, Audre Lorde, and Adrienne Rich have profoundly affected our political imaginations-and perhaps restricted too much what we allow as a friendly body and political language.30 They insist on the organic, opposing it to the technological.</p>
<p>32  •   A Manifesto for Cyborgs</p>
<p>feminist paganism, replete with organicisms, can only be understood in Sandoval&#39;s terms as oppositional ideologies fitting the late twentieth century. They would simply bewilder anyone not preoccupied with the machines and consciousness of late capitalism. In that sense they are</p>
<p>part of the cyborg world. But there are also great riches for feminists in explicitly embracing the possibilities inherent in the breakdown of clean distinctions between organism and machine and similar distinc­ tions structuring the Western self. It is the simultaneity of breakdowns that cracks the matrices of domination and opens geometric possibili­ ties. What might be learned from personal and political &quot;technological&quot; pollution? I will look briefly at two overlapping groups of texts for their insight into the construction of a potentially helpful cyborg myth: con­ structions of women of color and monstrous selves in feminist science fiction.</p>
<p>Earlier I suggested that &quot;women ofcolor&quot; might be understood as a cy­ borg identity, a potent subjectivity synthesized from fusions of outsider identities. There are material and cultural grids mapping this potential. Audre Lorde captures the tone in the title ofher <em>Sister Outsider.</em> In my po­ litical myth, Sister Outsider is the offshore woman, whom U.S. workers, female and feminized, are supposed to regard as the enemy preventing their solidarity, threatening their security. Onshore, inside the boundary of the United States, Sister Outsider is a potential amidst the races and ethnic identities of women manipulated for division, competition, and exploitation in the same industries. &quot;Women of color&quot; are the preferred labor force for the science-based industries, the real women for whom the worldwide sexual market, labor market, and politics of reproduction kaleidoscope into daily life. Young Korean women hired in the sex indus­ try and in electronics assembly are recruited from high schools, educated for the integrated circuit. Literacy, especially in English, distinguishes the &quot;cheap&quot; female labor so attractive to the multinationals.</p>
<p>Contrary to orientalist stereotypes of the &quot;oral primitive,&quot; literacy is a special mark of women of color, acquired by U.S. black women as well as men through a history of risking death to learn and to teach reading and writing. Writing has a special sig ficance for all colonized groups. Writing has been crucial to the Western h ofthe distinction oforal and written cultures, primitive and civilized      entalities, and more recently to the erosion of that distinction in &quot;post-modernist&quot; theories attacking</p>
<p>the phallogocentrism of the West, with its worship of the monotheistic, phallic, authoritative, and singular word, the unique and perfect name.31 Contests for the meanings ofwriting are a major form of cont�mporary political struggle. Releasing the play of writing is deadly serious. The</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>poetry and stories of U.S. women of color are repeatedly about writing, about access to the power to signify; but this time that power must be neither phallic nor innocent. Cyborg writing must not be about the Fall, the imagination of a once-upon-a-time wholeness before language, before writing, before Man. Cyborg writing is about the power to survive, not on the basis oforiginal innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark the world that marked them as other.</p>
<p>The tools are often stories, retold stories, versions that reverse and dis­ place the hierarchical dualisms of naturalized identities. In retelling ori­ gin stories, cyborg authors subvert the central myths oforigin ofWestern culture. We have all been colonized by those origin myths, with their longing for fulfillment in apocalypse. The phallogocentric origin stories most crucial for feminist cyborgs are built into the literal technologies­ technologies that write the world, biotechnology and microelectronics­ that have recently textualized our bodies as code problems on the grid of C31. Feminist cyborg stories have the task of recoding communication and intelligence to subvert command and control.</p>
<p>Figuratively and literally, language politics pervade the struggles of women of color; and stories about language have a special power in the rich contemporary writing by U. S. women of color. For example, retellings of the story of the indigenous woman Malinche, mother of the mestizo &quot;bastard&quot; race of the new world, master of languages, and mistress of Cortes, carry special meaning for Chicana constructions of identity. Cherrie Moraga in <em>Loving in the War Years</em> explores the themes of identity when one never possessed the original language, never told the original story, never resided in the harmony of legitimate hetero­ sexuality in the garden of culture, and so cannot base identity on a myth or a fall from innocence and right to natural names, mother&#39;s or father&#39;s.32 Moraga&#39;s writing, her superb literacy, is presented in her poetry as the same kind of violation as Malinche&#39;s mastery of the con­ querer&#39;s language-a violation, an illegitimate production, that allows survival. Moraga&#39;s language is not &quot;whole&quot;; it is self-consciously spliced, a chimera of English and Spanish, both conqueror&#39;s languages. But it is this chimeric monster, without claim to an original language before violation, that crafts the erotic, competent, potent identities ofwomen ofcolor. Sis­ ter Outsider hints at the possibility of world survival not because of her innocence, but because of her ability to live on the boundaries, to write without the founding myth of original wholeness, with its inescapable apocalypse of final return to a deathly oneness that Man has imagined to be the innocent and all-powerful Mother, freed at the End from another spiral ofappropriation by her son. Writing marks Moraga&#39;s body, affirms it as the body of a woman of color, against the possibility of passing into</p>
<p>34  •   A Manifesto lor Cyborgs</p>
<p>the unmarked category of the Anglo father or into the orientalist myth of &quot;original illiteracy&quot; of a mother that never was. Malinche was mother here, not Eve before eating the forbidden fruit. Writing affirms Sister Outsider, not the Woman-before-the-Fall-into-Writing needed by the phallogocentric Family of Man.</p>
<p>Writing is pre-eminently the technology of cyborgs, etched surfaces of the late twentieth century. Cyborg politics is the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocen­ trism. That is why cyborg politics insist on noise and advocate pollu­ tion, rejoicing in the illegitimate fusions of animal and machine. These are the couplings which make Man and Woman so problematic, sub­ verting the structure of desire, the force imagined to generate language and gender, and so subverting the structure and modes of reproduc­ tion of &quot;Western&quot; identity, of nature and culture, of mirror and eye, slave and master, body and mind. &quot;We&quot; did not originally choose to be cyborgs, but choice grounds a liberal politics and epistemology that imagines the reproduction ofindividuals before the wider replications of &quot;texts.&quot;</p>
<p>From the perspective of cyborgs, freed of the need to ground poli­ tics in &quot;our&quot; privileged position of the oppression that incorporates all other dominations, the innocence of the merely violated, the ground of those closer to nature, we can see powerful possibilities. Feminisms and Marxisms have run aground on Western epistemological imperatives to construct a revolutionary subject from the perspective of a hierarchy of oppressions and/or a latent position ofmoral superiority, innocence, and greater closeness to nature. With no available original dream of a com­ mon language or original symbiosis promising protection from hostile &quot;masculine&quot; separation, but written into the play of a text that has no finally privileged reading or salvation history, to recognize &quot;oneself&quot; as fully implicated in the world, frees us of the need to root politics in iden­ tification, vanguard parties, p-urity, and mothering. Stripped of identity, the bastard race teaches about the power of the margins and the im­ portance of a mother like Malinche   Women of color have transformed her from the evil mother of masculi · st fear into the originally literate mother who teaches survival.</p>
<p>This is not just literary deconstruction, but liminal transformation. Every story that begins wit}:l original innocence and privileges the return to wholeness imagines the drama of life to be individuation, separa­ tion, the birth of the self, the tragedy of autonomy, the fall into writing, alienation; i.e., war, tempered by imaginary respite in the  bosom of the</p>
<p>Other. These plots are ruled by a reproductive politics-rebirth with­ out flaw, perfection, abstraction. In this plot women are imagined either better or worse off, but all agree they have less selfhood, weaker indi­ viduation, more fusion to the oral, to Mother, less at stake in masculine autonomy. But there is another route to having less at stake in masculine autonomy, a route that does not pass through Woman, Primitive, Zero, the Mirror Stage and its imaginary. It passes through women and other present-tense, illegitimate cyborgs, not of Woman born, who refuse the ideological resources of victimization so as to have a real life. These cy­ borgs are the people who refuse to disappear on cue, no matter how many times a &quot;Western&quot; commentator remarks on the sad passing of another primitive, another organic group done in by &quot;Western&quot; tech­ nology, by writing.33 These real-life cyborgs, e.g., the Southeast Asian village women workers in Japanese and U.S. electronics firms described by Aiwa Ong, are actively rewriting the texts oftheir bodies and societies. Survival is the stakes in this play of readings.</p>
<p>To recapitulate, certain dualisms have been persistent in Western tradi­ tions; they have all been systemic to the logics and practices of domina­ tion of women, people of color, nature, workers, animals-in short, domination of all constituted as <em>others,</em> whose task is to mirror the self. Chief among these troubling dualisms are self/other, mind/body, culture/nature, male/female, civilized/primitive, reality/appearance, whole/part, agent/resource, maker/made, active/passive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, total/partial, God/man. The self is the One who is not dominated, who knows that by the service of the other; the other is the one who holds the future, who knows that by the experience of dom­ ination, which gives the lie to the autonomy of the self. To be One is to be autonomous, to be powerful, to be God; but to be One is to be an illusion, and so to be involved in a dialectic of apocalypse with the other. Yet to be other is to be multiple, without clear boundary, frayed, insubstantial. One is too few, but two are too many.</p>
<p>High-tech culture challenges these dualisms in intriguing ways. It is not clear who makes and who is made in the relation between human and machine. It is not clear what is mind and what body in machines that re­ solve into coding practices. Insofar as we know ourselves in both formal discourse (e.g., biology) and in daily practice (e.g., the homework econ­ omy in the integrated circuit), we find ourselves to be cyborgs, hybrids, mosaics, chimeras. Biological organisms have become biotic systems, communications devices like others. There is no fundamental, ontolog­ ical separation in our formal knowledge of machine and organism, of technical and organic.</p>
<p>36  •   A Manifesto for Cyborgs</p>
<p>One consequence is that our sense ofconnection to our tools is height­ ened. The trance state experienced by many computer users has become a staple of science-fiction film and cultural jokes. Perhaps paraplegics and other severely handicapped people can (and sometimes do) have the most intense experiences of complex hybridization with other com­ munication devices. Anne McCaffrey&#39;s <em>The Ship Who Sang</em> explored the consciousness of a cyborg, hybrid of girl&#39;s brain and complex machinery, formed after the birth of a severely handicapped child. Gender, sexual­ ity, embodiment, skill: all were reconstituted in the story. Why should our bodies end at the skin, or include at best other beings encapsu­ lated by skin? From the seventeenth century till now, machines could be animated-given ghostly souls to make them speak or move or to account for their orderly development and mental capacities. Or organ­ isms could be mechanized-reduced to body understood as resource of mind. These machine/organism relationships are obsolete, unnecessary. For us, in imagination and in other practice, machines can be prosthetic devices; intimate components, friendly selves. We don&#39;t need organic holism to give impermeable wholeness, the total woman and her fem­ inist variants (mutants?). Let me conclude this point by a very partial reading of the logic of the cyborg monsters of my second group of texts, feminist science fiction.</p>
<p>The cyborgs populating feminist science fiction make very problem­ atic the statuses of man or woman, human, artifact, member of a race, individual identity, or body. Katie King clarifies how pleasure in read­ ing these fictions is not largely based on identification. Students facing Joanna Russ for the first time, students who have learned to take mod­ ernist writers like James Joyce or Virginia Woolf without flinching, do not know what to make of <em>The Adventures ofAlyx</em> or <em>The Female Man,</em> where characters refuse the reader&#39;s search for innocent wholeness while granting the wish for heroic quests, exuberant eroticism, and serious politics. <em>The Female Man</em> is the story of four versions of one genotype, all of whom meet, but even taken	o not make a whole, re­ solve the dilemmas of violent moral acti n, nor remove the growing scandal of gender. The feminist science   tion of Samuel Delany, espe­ cially <em>Tales ofNeverjion,</em> mocks stories of origin by redoing the neolithic revolution, replaying the founding moves of Western civilization to sub­ vert their plausibility. James Tiptree, Jr., an author whose fiction was regarded as particularly maqly until her &quot;true&quot; gender was revealed, tells tales of reproduction based on non-mammalian technologies like alter­ nation of generations or male brood pouches and male nurtl!ring. John Varley constructs a supreme cyborg in his arch-feminist exploration of</p>
<p>Gaea, a mad goddess-planet-trickster-old woman-technological device on whose surface an extraordinary array of post-cyborg symbioses are spawned. Octavia Butler writes ofan African sorceress pitting her powers of transformation against the genetic manipulations of her rival <em>( Wild Seed),</em> of time warps that bring a modern U.S. black woman into slavery where her actions in relation to her white master-ancestor determine the possibility of her own birth <em>( Kindred) ,</em> and of the illegitimate insights into identity and community ofan adopted cross-species child who came to know the enemy as self <em>( Survivor) .</em></p>
<p>Because it is particularly rich in boundary transgressions, Vonda Mcintyre&#39;s <em>Superluminal</em> can close this truncated catalogue ofpromising monsters who help redefine the pleasures and politics of embodiment and feminist writing. In a fiction where no character is &quot;simply&quot; human, human status is highly problematic. Orca, a genetically altered diver, can speak with killer whales and survive deep ocean conditions, but she longs to explore space as a pilot, necessitating bionic implants jeopardizing her kinship with the divers and cetaceans. Transformations are effected by virus vectors carrying a new developmental code, by transplant surgery, by implants of microelectronic devices, by analogue doubles, and other means. Laenea becomes a pilot by accepting a heart implant and a host of other alterations allowing survival in transit at speeds exceeding that of light. Radu Dracul survives a virus-caused plague on his outerworld planet to find himself with a time sense that changes the boundaries of spatial perception for the whole species. All the characters explore the limits oflanguage, the dream of communicating experience, and the ne­ cessity oflimitation, partiality, and intimacy even in this world ofprotean transformation and connection.</p>
<p>Monsters have always defined the limits of community in Western imag­ inations. The Centaurs and Amazons of ancient Greece established the limits of the centered polis of the Greek male human by their disruption of marriage and boundary pollutions of the warrior with animality and woman. Unseparated twins and hermaphrodites were the confused hu­ man material in early modern France who grounded discourse on the natural and super-natural, medical and legal, portents and diseases-all crucial to establishing modern identity.34 The evolutionary and behav­ ioral sciences ofmonkeys and apes have marked the multiple boundaries oflate-twentieth-century industrial identities. Cyborg monsters in fem­ inist science fiction define quite different political possibilities and limits from those proposed by the mundane fiction of Man and Woman.</p>
<p>There are several consequences to taking seriously the imagery of cyborgs as other than our enemies. Our bodies, ourselves; bodies are</p>
<p>38  •   A Manifesto lor Cyborgs</p>
<p>maps of power and identity. Cyborgs are no exceptions. A cyborg body is not innocent; it was not born in a garden; it does not seek unitary identity and so generate antagonistic dualisms without end (or until the world ends); it takes irony for granted. One is too few, and two is only one possibility. Intense pleasure in skill, machine skill, ceases to be a sin, but an aspect of embodiment. The machine is not an <em>it</em> to be animated, worshiped and dominated. The machine is us, our processes, an aspect of our embodiment. We can be responsible for machines; <em>they</em> do not dominate or threaten us. We are responsible for boundaries; we are they. Up till now (once upon a time), female embodiment seemed to be given, organic, necessary; and female embodiment seemed to mean skill in mothering and its metaphoric extensions. Only by being out of place could we take intense pleasure in machines, and then with excuses that this was organic activity after all, appropriate to females. Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment. Gender might not be global identity after all.</p>
<p>The ideologically charged question ofwhat counts as daily activity, as</p>
<p>experience, can be approached by exploiting the cyborg image. Feminists have recently claimed that women are given to dailiness, that women more than men somehow sustain daily life, and so have a privileged epistemological position potentially. There is a compelling aspect to this claim, one that makes visible unvalued female activity and names it as the ground of life. But <em>the</em> ground of life? What about all the ignorance of women, all the exclusions and failures of knowledge and skill? What about men&#39;s access to daily competence, to knowing how to build things, to take them apart, to play? What about other embodiments? Cyborg gender is a local possibility taking a global vengeance. Race, gender, and capital require a cyborg theory of wholes and parts. There is no drive in cyborgs to produce total theory, but there is an intimate experience of boundaries, their construction and deconstruction. There is a myth system waiting to become a political language to ground one way of looking at science and technology and c a enging the informatics of domination.</p>
<p>One last image: organisms and organis ic, holistic politics depend on metaphors of rebirth and invariably call on the resources of reproductive sex. I would suggest that cyborgs have more to do with regeneration and are suspicious of the reproductive matrix and of most birthing. For sala­ manders, regeneration after injury, such as the loss of a limb, involves regrowth of structure and restoration of function with the constant pos­ sibility of twinning or other odd topographical productions at the site</p>
<p>of former injury. The regrown limb can be monstrous, duplicated, po­ tent. We have all been injured, profoundly. We require regen�ration, not</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>rebirth, and the possibilities for our reconstitution include the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender.</p>
<p>Cyborg imagery can help express two crucial arguments in this essay: ( 1) the production of universal, totalizing theory is a major mistake that misses most of reality, probably always, but certainly now; (2) taking responsibility for the social relations of science and technology means refusing an anti-science metaphysics, a demonology of technology, and so means embracing the skillful task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily life, in partial connection with others, in communication with all of our parts. It is not just that science and technology are possible means of great human satisfaction, as well as a matrix of complex dominations. Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves. This is a dream not of a common language, but of a powerful infidel heteroglossia. It is an imagination of a feminist speaking in tongues to strike fear into the circuits of the super-savers of the new right. It means both building and destroying machines, identities, categories, relationships, spaces, stories. Though both are bound in the spiral dance, I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess.</p>

<li>Katie King has developed a theoretically sensitive treatment of the workings of feminist taxonomies as genealogies of power in feminist ideology and polemic: &quot;Prospectus,&#39;&#39; <em>Gender and Genre: Academic Practice and the Making of Criticism</em> (Santa Cruz, Calif.: University of California, <em>1984).</em> King examines an intelligent, problematic example of taxonomizing feminisms to make a little machine producing the desired final position: Alison Jaggar, <em>Feminist Politics and Human Nature</em> ( Totowa, N.J.: Rowman &amp; Allanheld, <em>1983).</em> My caricature here of socialist and radical feminism is also an example.</li>
