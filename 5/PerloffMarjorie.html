<p>&#39;&#39;VIOLENCE AND PRECISION&#39;&#39;: THE MANIFESTO AS ART FORM</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1913, at the height of the manifesto fever that swept across Europe in the years preceding the First World War, Gino Severini, then living in Paris, sent the manuscript of a projected manifesto to F. T. Marinetti in Milan.1 Here is Marinetti&#39;s reply:</p>
<p>I have read with great attention your manuscript, which contains very interesting things. But I must tell you that it has nothing of the <em>manifesto</em> in it.</p>
<p>First of all, the title absolutely won&#39;t do because it is too generic, too derivative of the titles of other manifestos. In the second place, you must take out the part in which you restate the <em>merde</em> and <em>rose</em> of Apollinaire, this being, in absolute contrast to our type of manifesto, a way of praising a single artist by repeating his own eulogies and insults. Moreover</p>
<p>... you must not repeat what I have  already  said,  in <em>Futurism</em> and elsewhere, about the futurist sensibility. The rest of the material is very good and very important, but to publish it as is would be to publish an article that is excellent but not yet a manifesto. I therefore advise you to take it back and reword it, removing all that I have already mentioned, and intensifying and tightening it, recasting the whole new part in the form of <em>Manifesto (informa di Manifesto)</em> and not in that of the review-article about futurist  painting....</p>
<p>I think I shall persuade you by all that I know about <em>the</em></p>
<p><em>art of making manifestos (da/1&#39; arte di far manifesti),</em> which I possess, and by my desire to place in <em>full</em> light, not in <em>half</em> light, your own remarkable genius as a futurist. 2</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>To give one&#39;s text &quot;the form of <em>Manifesto&quot;-a</em> form Marinetti defined in an earlier letter to the Belgian painter Henry Maassen as requiring, above all, &quot;de la violence et de la precision&quot;38this was to create what was essentially a new genre, a genre that might meet the needs of a mass audience even as, paradoxically, it insisted on the avant-garde, the esoteric, the anti-bourgeois. The Futurist man­ ifesto was a way of aestheticizing what had traditionally been a vehicle for political statement:4 witness this definition in the OED:</p>
<p>MANIFESTO: (1647) A public declaration or proclamation, usually issued with the sanction of a sovereign prince or state, or by an individual or body of individuals whose proceedings are of public importance, for the purpose of making known past actions and explaining the reasons or motives for actions as forthcoming.</p>
<p>Trusting neither &quot;the sanction of a sovereign prince or state&quot; nor the existence of a political body &quot;whose proceedings are of public importance,&quot; the Futurists created an art form designed to erase the traditional line between creation and criticism. In their curiously mixed discourse, they anticipated many of the so-called &quot;critical texts&quot; of our own time, texts that are not quite &quot;theory&quot; or &quot;poetry&quot; but that occupy a space between the traditional modes and genres.</p>
<p>The shrewd  recipe that  Marinetti  sent  to Henry  Maassen­ &quot; Maassen-&quot;l&#39;accusation <em>precise,</em> l&#39;insulte bien <em>definie</em> &quot;-made its</p>
<p>first appearance in Marinetti&#39;s  <em>Fondation  et  Manifeste  du Futurisme,</em> published in Paris on the front page of the <em>Figaro</em> on 20 February 1909. The <em>Figaro</em> headnote reads:</p>
<p><strong>M.</strong> Marinetti, the young Italian and French poet, whose remarkable and fiery talent has been made <strong>known</strong> throughout the Latin countries by his notorious demonstrations and who has a galaxy of enthusiastic disciples, has just founded the school of &quot;Futurism,&quot; whose theories surpass in daring all previous and contemporary schools. The <em>Figaro,</em> which has already provided a rostrum for a number of these schools, and by no means minor ones, today offers its readers the Manifesto of the &quot;Futurists.&quot; Is it necessary to say that we assign to the author himself full responsibility for his singu­ larly audacious ideas and his frequently unwarranted extrav­ agance in the face of things that are eminently respectable and, happily, everywhere respected? But we thought it inter­ esting to reserve for our readers the first publication of this manifesto, whatever their judgement of it will be.5</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>This bit of mythmaking sets the tone for the brilliant propaganda machine to come. I say mythmaking because the fact is that Marinetti became a public figure as a result of, not prior to, the publication of the First Futurist Manifesto. Even more ironically, the Marinetti whose &quot;theories&quot; were ostensibly more &quot;daring&quot; than those of &quot;all previous and contemporary schools,&quot; was writing, as late as 1909, decadent versions of Baudelairean lyric like ,the fol­ lowing:</p>
<p>Mon bel ange sensuel, brulant et trempe des voluptes du ciel et de l&#39;enfer! ...</p>
<p>Je tends les bras eperdument vers toi dans la profonde solitude</p>
<p>de cette nuit etincelante qui m&#39;inon&lt;le</p>
<p><em>d&#39; un flat d&#39;</em> etoiles glacees! ...</p>
<p>(My beautiful, sensual angel, burning and bathed in the pleasures of heaven and hell!</p>
<p>Madly, I hold out my arms to you in the deep solitude</p>
<p>of this glittering night that floods me with a cascade of frozen stars! ... )</p>
<p>This is the first stanza of &quot;Le Dompteur&quot; (&quot;The Vanquisher&quot;), published in <em>Akademos</em> just a month before th$! publication of the First Manifesto. It ends with the lines:</p>
<p>Ta chair, ta chair et sa chaleur tout entieere, et son arome qui embaume a jamais</p>
<p>la terre en deuil ou je vais creusant un sillon monotone,</p>
<p>Ta chair, to chair et sa chaleur tout entiere,</p>
<p>je I&#39; attends!6</p>
<p>(Your flesh, your flesh and all its naked warmth and its scent that forever perfumes</p>
<p>with mourning the earth where I wander cutting a monotonous path,</p>
<p>your flesh and all its deliverance, I wait for it!)</p>
<p>Within a year, in <em>The Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting,</em> Umberto Boccioni and his fellow artists were to launch their attack on &#39;&#39;the nude in painting, as nauseous and as tedious as adultery in literature.&quot;&quot; Artists,&quot; Boccioni declared, &quot;obsessed with the desire</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>to expose the bodies of their mistresses have transformed the Salons into arrays of unwholesome flesh.&quot;7 He might have been talking about Marinetti&#39;s &quot;Ta chair, ta chair et sa saveur tout entiere.&quot;</p>
<p>The 1909 Manifesto thus reflects Marinetti&#39;s program for the future rather than his own poetic practice. As a lyric poet, he was a mediocre late Symbolist; as a thinker, he was almost wholly deriva­ tive, his extravagant statements being easily traceable to Nietzsche and Bergson, Jarry and Georges Sorel.8 But as what we now call a conceptual artist, Marinetti was incomparable, the strategy of his manifestos, performances, recitations, and fictions being to trans­ form politics into a kind of lyric theatre. We can see this transforma­ tion if we compare the 1909 Manifesto to such related documents of the decade as Saint-Georges de Bouhelier&#39;s <em>Manifeste Naturiste (Le Figaro,</em> 1897), Jules Romains&#39; manifesto <em>Les Sentiments unanimes et la poesie (Le Penseur,</em> 1905), and Ernst Ludwig Kirchner&#39;s <em>Pro­ gramfiir die Briicke</em> (1906), which was the first manifesto written by a visual artist.</p>
<p>Each of these manifestos antici(&gt;ates themes that turn up in Marinetti&#39;s writings. Saint-Georges de Bouhelier, for example, de­ clares himself to be the enemy of <em>Symbolisme</em> as it was codified by Jean Moreas in his famous manifesto of 1886. Against such notions as art for art&#39;s sake, elitism, transcendence (&quot;des Idees primor­ diales&quot;), and willed obscurity (&quot;un style archetype et complexe  ... les mysterieuses ellipses&quot;),9 de Bouhelier contends that &quot;les horn­ mes nouveaux&quot; must tum to populism, nationalism, energy, and violence:</p>
<p>The art of the future must be heroic. Moreover, we have invented a new conception of the world. For that military intoxication that not long ago so strongly moved our fathers, has been transformed by us into a sort of cult of strength from which no one will be able to escape. We will glorify the hero. (Mitchell, p. 59).</p>
<p>For de Bouhelier, the hero is specifically the farm laborer, the peasant who is at one with nature. But the populist notion was soon transferred to the urban worker: Jules Romains begins his Unanimist manifesto as follows:</p>
<p>At the persent time, the life of civilized man has assumed a new character. Essential changes have given a different meaning  to  our  existence.... The  actual  tendency  of  the people to mass together in the cities; the uninterrupted de­ velopment of social relationships; ties stronger and more</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>binding established between men by their duties, their occu­ pations, their common pleasures; an encroachment, even greater, of the public on the private, the collective on the individual: here are the facts that certain people deplore but that no one contests. (Mitchell, p. 81)</p>
<p>In the modern city, the street becomes a kind of theatre-&quot;alive, endowed with a global existence and unanimous feelings&quot; (p. 82). Art is the natural expression of this <em>unanimisme:</em> &quot; ... I strongly believe that the bonds of feeling between a man and his city, that the whole ethos, the large movements of consciousness, the colossal passions of human groups are capable of creating a profound lyricism or a superb epic cycle&quot; (p. 83).</p>
<p>A new urban mass art (Romains), an art of heroic violence and nationalism (de Bouhelier), an art that breaks defiantly with tradition as Ludwig Kirchner argued in a proclamation for <em>Die Briicke,</em> hand­ printed on a woodcut and widely distributed:</p>
<p>with faith in development and in a new generation of creators and appreciators we call together all youth. As youth, we carry the future and want to create for ourselves freedom of life and of movement against the long-established older forces. Everyone who with directness and authenticity con­ veys that which drives him to creation, belongs to us.•0</p>
<p>Such calls for freedom, for the necessity of inventing a New Art, go hand in hand with the spread of literacy and the use of print media in the later nineteenth century. As early as 1850, the Pre­ Raphaelite magazine, <em>The Germ,</em> bore on its back cover the follow­ ing statement:</p>
<p>This periodical will consist of original Poems, Stories to de­ velop thought and principle, Essays concerning Art and other subjects, and analytic Reviews of current Literature­ particularly of Poetry. Each number will also contain an Etching; the subject will be taken from the opening articles of the month.</p>
<p>An attempt will be made, both intrinsically and by re­ view, to claim for Poetry that place to which its present de­ velopment in the literature of this country so emphatically entitles it. The endeavor held in view throughout the writings on art will be to encourage and enforce an entire adherence to the simplicity of nature; and also to direct attention, as an auxiliary medium, to the comparatively few works which Art has yet produced in this spirit.11</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>Notice <em>The Germ&#39;s</em> emphasis on group aesthetic, its insistence that dramatic change must take place if the right kind of art is to flourish. But neither in <em>The Germ</em> nor in its successors-The <em>Yellow Book</em> and <em>The Savoy</em> in England; <em>Lutece</em> and  <em>La  Plume</em>  in France-do the manifestos and critical essays claim to be more than texts of mediation, designed to lead the audience to the proper view of a given artist or movement. The novelty of Italian Futurist man­ ifestos, in this context, is their brash refusal to remain in the expos­ itory or clinical order, their understanding that the group pro­ nouncement, sufficiently aestheticized, can, in the eyes of the mass audience, all but take the place of the promised art work. Indeed, when a few months after its <em>Figaro</em> publication, Marinetti declaimed the 1909 Manifesto from the stage of the Teatro Alfieri in Torino, preceding the performance of his play <em>Les Poupees electriques,</em> the audience all but disregarded the play itself (a fable of husband and wife, plagued by the mechanical puppets made by the former­ puppets that, as allegorical embodiments of bourgeois duty, money, and old age, tum out to be the couple&#39;s own alter egos)128and re­ sponded to the drama of the manifesto.</p>
<p>The typical manifestos of the period open with a particular as­ sertion or generalization about the arts. For example:</p>
<p>There are, in art, problems of circumstance and prob­ lems that are essential. The former change every fifteen years, every thirty years, and every  half-century, according to whether the issue is one of fashion, of taste, or of custom.</p>
<p>The more ephemeral they are, the more they absorb the at­ tention.13</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Never has a time been more favorable to artistic dis­ putes. The Athenian Republic of modem times takes a pas­ sionate interest in them, and judges and condemns five or six times a year, on the occasion of a Salon, a concert, or a play.14</p>
<p>Here, by contrast, is the opening of Marinetti&#39;s 1909 Manifesto:</p>
<p>We had stayed up all night, my friends and I, under hanging mosque lamps with domes of filigreed brass, domes starred like our spirits, shining like them with the prisoned radiance of electric hearts. For hours we had trampled our atavistic ennui into rich oriental rugs, arguing up to the last confines of logic and blackening many reams of paper with</p>
<p>our frenzied scribbling. (Flint, p. 39)15</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>Not exposition-the controversial statement, the daring generalization-but <em>narrative:</em> this invention was one of Marinetti&#39;s master strokes.  For when the eleven &quot;theses&quot; that follow in the body of the manifesto are placed within the narrative frame, their &quot;validity&quot; has already, so to speak, been established. So Marinetti begins by telling us about a particular night in Milan when he and his poet-friends stayed up till dawn, planning for the glorious future that would include &quot;stokers feeding the hellish fires of great ships,&quot; &quot;black spectres who grope in the red-hot bellies of locomotives launched down their crazy courses,&quot; &quot;drunkards reeling like wounded birds along the city walls&quot; (Flint, p. 39). As the night comes to an end, the friends are drawn outdoors,  not by bird-song or moonlight but by the ·•mighty noise of the huge double-decker trams that rumbled outside, ablaze with coloured lights, like villages on holiday suddenly struck and uprooted by the flooding Po and dragged over falls and through gorges to the sea.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Violence and precision-here</em> is Marinetti&#39;s formula put into action. The friends dash outside and take off in their three motor cars <em>(calledfauves</em> in the French version),16 travelling with break­ neck speed so that &quot;Here and there, sick lamplight through window glass taught us to distrust the deceitful mathematics of our perishing eyes.&quot; In this newly discovered fantastic landscape, everything is transformed. The &quot;ideal Mistress&quot; of Romantic and Symbolist poetry gives way to the machine, capable of &quot;hurling watchdogs against doorsteps, curling them under our burning tires <strong>like</strong> collars under a flatiron&quot; (p. 40). Marinetti himself almost meets the same fate: just when the drive is at its most exhilarating, his car comes up against two cyclists, swerves, and turns over in a womb-like ditch:</p>
<p>0 maternal ditch, almost full of muddy water! Fair fac­ tory drain! I gulped down your nourishing sludge; and I re­ membered the blessed black breast of my Sudanese nurse.</p>
<p>.  . . When I came up-tom, filthy, and stinking-from  under the capsized car, I felt the white-hot iron of joy deliciously pass through my heart! (pp. 40--41; ellipses are Marinetti&#39;s).</p>
<p>Capsized, the automobile is reborn: &quot;Up it came from the ditch, slowly, leaving in the bottom, like scales, its heavy framework of good sense and its soft upholstery of comfort.&quot; Accordingly, their &quot;faces smeared with good factory muck,&quot; with &quot;celestial soot,&quot; the group can put forward its program.</p>
<p>Marinetti&#39;s narrative contains a good deal of intentional buf­ foonery and declamation: everything is presented in the most ex­ treme terms possible: the automobile as a beautiful shark, &quot;running on its powerful fins,&quot; the steering wheel like &quot;a guillotine blade that</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>threatened my stomach,&quot; and so on. The language, as Luciano de Maria has noted,18 is still heavily Symbolist: the maternal ditch, the overturning of the car as rebirth metaphor, the &quot;electric hearts&quot; of the hanging mosque lamps, and so on. But these images do not point inward to the self; they reflect neither inner struggle nor the contours of an individual consciousness. On the contrary, Marinetti&#39; s self­ hood is subordinated to the communal &quot;We&quot; (the first word of the manifesto), addressing the &quot;you&quot; of the crowd, the mass audience whom he hopes to move as well as to delight. In its reliance on hyperbole and parody (the reference to the &quot;maternal ditch&quot; im­ mediately leads to the memory of &quot;the black breast of my Sudanese nurse&quot;), Marinetti&#39;s <em>symbolisme</em> takes on a hard edge; his landscape of capsized cars and factory drains has less in common with, say, Mallarme&#39;s &quot;transparent glacier&quot; than with the animated surface of the Walt Disney cartoon.</p>
<p>In its celebration of what D. H. Lawrence, an early admirer of Marinetti, called &#39;&#39;the inhuman will,&#39;&#39;19 the 1909 manifesto strikes an oddly impersonal note. It is lyrical (in the sense of choric), de­ clamatory, and oracular without being in the least self-revelatory or intimate. Not that Marinetti didn&#39;t possess, as did Lawrence, an enormous ego, decry ego as he might. But in his manifestos and other writings, questions of psychology and personal emotion are consistently subordinated to the discourse&#39;s pathetic argument, its appeal to the audience to join the movement. Marinetti thus uses question, exhortation, repetition, digression, tropes, and rhetorical figures to draw the audience into his radius of discourse. For exam­ ple:</p>
<p>That one should make an annual pilgrimage, just as one goes to the graveyard on All Souls&#39; Day-that I grant. That once a year one should leave a floral tribute beneath the <em>Gioconda</em> I grant you that. ... But I don&#39;t admit that our sorrows, our fragile courage, our morbid restlessness should be given a daily conducted tour through the museums. Why poison ourselves? Why rot? (p. 42; ellipses are Marinetti&#39;s)20</p>
<p>A man on his feet talking, Charles Olson might have said of this. Or again, &quot;ONE PERCEPTION MUST IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY LEAD TO A FURTHER PERCEPTION ...   get on</p>
<p>with it, keep moving, keep in, speed, the nerves, their speed        &quot;21</p>
<p>You have objections?-Enough! Enough!  We  know them ... we&#39;ve understood! ...  Our fine deceitful intelli­ gence tells us that we are the revival and extension of our ancestors-perhaps! ...    If only it were so!-But who cares?</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>We don&#39;t want to understand! ... Woe to anyone who says those infamous words to us again! (p. 44; ellipses Marinetti&#39;s)22</p>
<p>I shall discuss the theatricality of Marinetti&#39;s manifestos below. But first, let us look at the theses he puts forward. Here are the first four:</p>
<p>l. We intend to sing the love of danger, the habit of energy and fearlessness.</p>
<ol start='2' >
<li>Courage, audacity, and revolt will be essential ele­ ments of our poetry.</li>
<li>Up to now literature has exalted a pensive immobility, ecstasy, and sleep. We intend to exalt aggressive action, a feverish insomnia, the racer&#39;s stride, the mortal leap, the punch and the slap.</li>
<li>We affirm that the world&#39;s magnificence has been en­ riched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed. A racing car whose hood is adorned with great pipes, like serpents of ex­ plosive breath-a roaring car  that seems to ride on grapeshot is more beautiful than the <em>Victory of Samothrace.</em> (p. 41)</li>

</ol>
<p>Marinetti&#39;s cult of energy, aggressiveness, violence, and heroism is not unlike that of such manifesto-writers as de Bouhelier and Ro­ mains. But here, the theses are not ennumerated until the narrative</p>
<p>has already presented them in action: we have witnessed the &quot;feverish insomnia&quot; of the poet and his friends, the &quot;racer&#39;s stride&quot; and the worship of the &quot;roaring car that seems to ride  on grapeshot.&quot; Accordingly, when we come to the ninth thesis, &quot;We will glorify war-the  world&#39;s only  hygiene-militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn of woman&quot; (p. 42), we don&#39;t question it as closely as we might; indeed, war is made to look like the necessary prelude to a new world composed of &quot;great crowds excited by work,&quot; of &quot;polyphonic  tides of revolution in the modem capitals,&quot; of the • &#39;vibrant nightly fervor of arsenals and shipyards blazing with violent electric moons&quot; (p. 42). Images of sound and color and kine­ tic motion are foregrounded, the rhetorical strategy of the manifesto being to minimize the possibilities for rumination on the reader&#39;s part.</p>
<p>Marinetti claimed to have received more than 10,000 letters and articles in response to the publication of his manifesto in the <em>Figaro,</em> and although much of this mail was negative, even angry and jeer­ ing,23 the response tells us a great deal about manifesto art. The eleventh and final thesis, for example, is often cited as a description</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>of what Boccioni, Balla, and Carra were doing in their paintings; yet the painters had not yet produced a single &quot;Futurist&quot; painting at the time that Marinetti was writing his paean to &#39;&#39; shipyards blazing with violent electric moons&quot;; to:</p>
<p>greedy railway stations that devour smoke-plumed serpents; factories hung on clouds by the crooked lines of their smoke; bridges that stride the rivers like giant gymnasts, flashing in the sun with a glitter of knives; adventurous steamers that sniff the horizon; deep-chested locomotives whose wheels paw the tracks like the hooves of enormous steel horses bri­ dled by tubing; and the sleek flight of planes whose propellers chatter in the wind like banners and seem to cheer like an enthusiastic crowd. (p. 42)24</p>
<p>Just as Gertrude Stein began to resemble her portrait by Picasso only years after he had painted it, so the Futurist paintings (for example, Boccioni&#39;s <em>The City Rises</em> of 1910-11 or Carra&#39;s <em>Funeral of the Anarchist Galli</em> of 1911-12 were painted only <em>after</em> the publication of the manifesto as if Marinetti&#39;s Nietzschean prophecies (&quot;In truth I tell you ... &quot;) had to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>But it is not enough to say of this and subsequent Futurist</p>
<p>manifestos that theory·preceded practice, that, say, Russolo&#39;s &quot;The Art of Noises&quot; (1913) outlined the new sounds of the &quot;Futurist orchestra&quot; before the machines made to produce these sounds had been invented.  For the real point is that the theory,  in Russolo&#39;s as in Marinetti&#39;s manifesto, <em>is</em> the practice in that the text foregrounds what Giovanni Lista calls &quot;the problematic of the precedence of project to work, of metalanguages to creation&quot; (Lista, p. 103). To talk about art becomes equivalent to making it, and indeed most historians of Italian Futurism agree that the series of fifty-odd man­ ifestos published between 1909 and Italy&#39;s entrance into the war in 1915 were the movement&#39;s literary form <em>par excellence.</em> 25 Not only are Marinetti&#39;s manifestos more interesting than his poems, novels, or even such experimental sound texts as <em>Zang Tumb Tuumb</em> (a failed collage work, as I have argued elsewhere); his <em>arte di far manifesti</em> became a way of questioning the status of traditional genres and media, of denying the separation between, say, lyric poem and short story or even between &quot;poem&quot; and &quot;picture.&quot; The conflation of &quot;music&quot; and &quot;noise,&quot; drama and theatrical gesture, narrative and exposition, which has become so important in our own art, is usually attributed to Dada, but, as I shall argue below, the mode of a text like Tristan Tzara&#39;s <em>Manfeste de monsieur Antipyrine</em> of 1916 is notably prefigured in Futurist manifesto. I should like, accordingly, to look more closely at that mode, as it evolved along the Milan-Paris axis.</p>

<li><em>Medium as Message</em></li>

</ol>
<p>The &quot;Manifesto of Futurist Painters&quot; was published as a leaflet by Marinetti&#39;sjoumal <em>Poesia</em> on 11 February  1910. It was composed by Umberto Boccioni and Luigi Russolo (although the signatures of Carlo Carra, Giacomo Balla, and Gino Severini were also affixed to it) in a single day, Marinetti joining the two artists in the evening so as to put on finishing touches.26 A few weeks later (18 March), the manifesto was declaimed from the stage of the Teatro Chiarella in Torino to an audience of approximately 3,000---artists, students, factory workers. Addressed &quot;TO THE YOUNG ARTISTS OF ITALY!&quot;, it adopted the violent rhetoric of contemporary political manifestos:</p>
<p>Comrades, we tell you now that the triumphant progress of science makes profound changes in humanity inevitable, changes which are hacking an abyss between those docile slaves of past tradition and us free modems, who are con­ fident in the radiant splendour of our future.</p>
<p>And again:</p>
<p>In the eyes of other countries, Italy is still a land of the dead, a vast Pompeii white with sepulchres. But Italy is being reborn. Its political resurgence will be followed by a cultural resurgence. In the land inhabited by the illiterate peasant, schools will be set up; in the land where doing nothing in the sun was the only available profession, millions of machines are already roaring <strong>(FM,</strong> pp. 24-25)27</p>
<p>The &quot;roaring machines&quot; are not only a prominent manifesto subject; they also provide the manifesto writer with a new typog­ raphic format, a format drawn from the world of advertising posters and newspapers, that was soon to find its way into the literature of the period. In the manifesto, the page supplants the stanza or the paragraph as the basic print unit, a situation that, when applied to lyric poetry, was to call into question the integrity of the verse line itself.</p>
<p>This emphasis on the page is already notable in some of the German Expressionist periodicals of the period, especially Kan­ dinsky and Marc&#39;s great almanac, <em>Der Blaue Reiter,</em> whose first edition appeared in May of 1912. The subscription prospectus, written by Marc in mid-January of that year, begins:</p>
<p>Today art is moving in a direction of which our fathers would never even have dreamed. We stand before the new</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>pictures as in a dream and we hear the apocalyptic horsemen in the air. There is an artistic tension all over Europe. Everywhere new artists are greeting each other. ...</p>
<p>everywhere new forces are sprouting like a beautiful unex­ pected seed. . . .</p>
<p>Out of the awareness of this secret connection of all new artistic production, we developed the idea of the <em>Blaue Re­ iter.</em>... The first  volume  herewith announced         includes</p>
<p>the latest movements in French, German, and Russian paint­ ing. It reveals subtle connections with Gothic and primitive art, with Africa and the vast Orient, with the highly expres­ sive, spontaneous folk and children&#39;s art, and especially with the most recent musical movements in Europe and the new ideas for the theater of our time.28</p>
<p>Thus Franz Marc&#39;s opening manifesto &quot;Spiritual Treasures&quot; (&quot;Geistige Giiter&quot;), which makes the case for a new art of &quot;mystical inner construction&quot; (&quot;die <em>mystisch-innerliche Konstruktion</em> &quot;), contains six illustrations for what is a four-page text: (1) a German woodcut from <em>Ritter vom Turn</em> of 1495 (2) a Chinese painting of unknown origin, probably a nineteenth-century imitation; (3) a small etching of a horse by Marc and, on the facing page, (4) a Bavarian mirror painting of the death of a saint from Raymundsreut in Bavaria, painted after 1800; (5) Picasso&#39;s <em>Woman with Mandolin at the Piano</em> (1911), and (6) two childrens&#39; drawings.29 These juxtapos­ itions are designed to illustrate the Almanac&#39;s theme that art knows no geographical or historical boundaries, that, say, a folk painting from Bavaria may contain the same spiritual and artistic truths as a Picasso. As an illustrated book, <em>Der Blaue Reiter</em> is thus highly original, forcing the reader to make startling connections between the &quot;primitive&quot; and the &quot;modem,&quot; between the medieval knight and the Benin warrior (see <strong>BR,</strong> pp. 128-129). The print format, on the other hand, is still quite conventional, captioned illustrations being carefully set apart from the type, which is arranged in blocks and serrated so that the eye travels in normal sequence form line to line.</p>
<p>It is this linearity that was called into question by the typog­ raphy of the Italian Futurist manifesto. As early as 1848, in the <em>Manifesto of the Communist Party,</em> Marx and Engels had used boldface headings, capitals, numbered series, and aphorisms, set off from the text, so as to capture the reader&#39;s attention;30 by the later nineteenth century, the world of advertising provided, as Arthur Cohen points out, further models:</p>

<p>The placard, the sandwich man, the poster, the sign, the ad­ vertisement, the leaflet, the broadside, prospectus, <em>prier d&#39; in­ serer,</em> ticket, handbill-all these methods of calling out, shouting, if you will, were devices of circumventing tradi­ tional language, imitating the sound of speech, and hence restoring to a kind of primacy, the original spoken rhythm which had been for millenia abstracted by written language .</p>
<p>. . . Since its [advertising&#39;s) intentions were thought to be vulgar, its means could be untraditional. Garishness of color, juxtapositions of bold wood typefaces, the use of illustrative cuts ... the mix of fonts, the stridency of exclamation points and underscorings, all these could be employed by the com­ mercial arm of the reigning bourgeoisie to advertise a product and to sell it. Typographic novelty began, so to speak, in the marketplace, catching the accelerated pace of an urban cul­ ture.30&quot;</p>
<p><em>L&#39;arte di far manifesti</em> was a way of infusing this commercial strain into the lyric fabric, the intent being to close the gap between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; art.31 Titles, for example, became very important. When Moreas published his manifesto of 1886, he called it quite simply &quot;Le Symbolisme&quot;; again, Jules Romains called his <em>un­ animiste</em> manifesto &quot;Les Sentiments unanimes de la poesie.&quot; Here, by contrast, are some of Marinetti&#39;s titles, usually printed in big black block letters: &quot;Let&#39;s Murder the Moonshine&quot; (&quot;Uccidiamo il Chiaro di Luna!&quot;), &quot;Against Past-Loving Venice&quot; (&quot;Contro Ven­ ezia passatista&quot;), &quot;Down with Tango and Parsifal&quot; (&quot; Abbasso il tango e Parsifal!&quot;), &quot;Destruction of Syntax-Imagination without Strings-Words in Liberty&quot; (&quot;Distruzione della sintassi­ lmmaginazione senza fili-Parole in liberta&quot;). To be memorable, Marinetti posited, a title must be concrete  and provocative enough to catch the eye as well as the ear. Other Futurists followed suit: &quot;Absolute Motion plus Relative Motion equals Dynamism&quot; (Boc­ cioni), &quot;Futurist Reconstruction of the Universe&quot; (Balla, Depero), &quot;Futurist Manifesto of Lust&quot; (Valentine de Saint-Point), and so on.</p>
<p>Subtitles also play a big role. In &quot;Imagination without Strings-Words set Free,&quot; Marinetti introduces such subtitles  as &quot;The  Semaphoric  Adjective,&quot;  &quot;Typographical  Revolution,&quot; &quot;Death of Free verse,&quot; and &quot;Multilinear Lyricism.&quot; These subtitles are usually printed in italics or bold face, the model being the news­ paper column. Under these headings, items are regularly numbered, again with boldface headings as in &#39;&#39;The Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting,&quot;  where we read &quot;WE  DECLARE,&quot; followed  by a list of nine items, and &quot;WE FIGHT,&quot; followed by a list of four.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>Pratella&#39;s &quot;Manifesto of Futurist Musicians&quot; (1910) similarly lists eleven stated aims, all in the infinitive and in capital letters, begin­ ning with the following:</p>
<p>\1. TO CONVINCE YOUNG COMPOSERS TO DESERT SCHOOLS, CONSERVATORIES AND MUSICAL ACADEMIES, AND TO CONSIDER FREE STUDY AS THE ONLY MEANS OF REGENERATION. (FM, p. 37)</p>
<p>Enumeration is, as the authors of political manifestos had long understood, a way of arresting the attention of the audience. The numbered principles or goals of the Futurists almost always shade into one another; they are all part of the same thrust. But numbering implies that the authors mean business, that the goals to be achieved are practical and specific. It also means that the individual units are short and immediately perceivable by the reader, as in the following list from &quot;Imagination without Strings&quot;:</p>
<ol start='' >
<li>Acceleration  of life to today&#39;s swift pace....</li>
<li>Dread of the old and the known. Love of the new, the unexpected.</li>
<li>Dread of quiet living, love of danger and an attitude of daily heroism.</li>
<li>Destruction of a sense of the Beyond and an increased value of the individual whose desire is <em>vivre sa vie,</em> in Bon­ not&#39;s phrase.</li>
<li>The multiplication and unbridling of human desires and ambitions. (FM, p. %)</li>

</ol>
<p>Sometimes, as in Marinetti&#39;s &quot;The Music Hall,&quot; first printed in <em>Lacerba</em> in October 1913 and then in English in <em>The Daily Mail</em> that November,32 different print faces, large type, numerical listing in bold-face, and the use of plus and equal signs are combined with what Marinetti called <em>parole in liberta,</em> that is, a string of nouns or noun phrases (usually concrete images) in apposition, with no con­ nectives between them, as well as with onomatopoeic articles. (See figure 4)</p>
<p>Here Marinetti wants to present us with a graphic image of his thesis that &#39;&#39;The Music-hall is absolutely practical, for it sets out to distract and to amuse the public by means of comic effects, erotic stimulation, or imaginative surprise&quot; (MEF, Illus. 35). Accordingly, the page contains advertising slogans in large bold type (SMOKE SMOKE MANOLI SMOKE MANOLI CIGARETTES: GIOCONDA ACQUA PURGATIVA ITALIANA); the sound of</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>screeching ambulance sirens <em>(teeeeeee teeeee siiiiiffiets),</em> and the cataloguing of measurements-&quot;woman in slip (50 m)&quot;; &quot;2  horses (30 m. high)&quot;-and mathematical symbols: &quot;trepidation+ hilarity+ brouhaha of the Music Hall.&quot; But, most important, the manifesto page substitutes white space or blanks for conventional punctuation so as to indicate an abrupt stop, a change of scene or image. The main effect is thus one of fragmentation. Once white space becomes an integral element of the composition, a kind of design feature, it is just a step to a manifesto like Apollinaire&#39;s &quot;L&#39; Antitradition futuriste&quot; (Figures 1 and 2).33</p>
<p>Apollinaire&#39;s manifesto has an equivocal place in the canon. According to Carlo Carra, the typographic arrangement was an af­ terthought, composed by Marinetti for the <em>Lacerba</em> edition (15 Sep­ tember 1913), and it is true that the earlier French edition <em>(Gil-Blas,</em> 3 August) did not have this lay-out. Apollinaire scholars have gone even further, arguing that, given Apollinaire&#39;s harsh criticism of the Futurists in 1912,34 the manifesto must be a parody. Indeed, Apol­ linaire&#39;s poet-friend Andre Salmon, who introduced the manifesto in <em>Gil-Blas,</em> wrote:</p>
<p>Futurism is dead! It is M. Guillaume Apollinaire, the poet of <em>A/cools,</em> the novelist of <em>Heresiarque et Cie,</em> who gave it its death blow in signing the manifesto you are about to read. It was necessary to do this: to be more futurist than Marinetti!</p>
<p>M. Guillaume Apollinaire has succeeded in it, to our joy. Here is the document, the originality of whose typography we regret not being able to follow entirely.</p>
<p>And Salmon refers to the manifesto as &quot;the most colossal hoax of the century.&#39;&#39; 35</p>
<p>Other critics have argued that the manifesto, though untypical of Apollinaire&#39;s response to Futurism, represents a brief flirtation with the Italian movement;36 still others, <strong>like</strong> Giovanni  Lista, suggest that, whatever Apollinaire may have said about Futurism in his essays and reviews, his own literary works-for example, &quot;Les Fenetres&quot; and &quot;Lettre-Ocean,&quot; not to mention &quot;Les Mamelles de Tiresias&quot;-are in fact closely allied to Futurist poetic.37</p>
<p>For our purposes here, it matters less whether Apollinaire was or was not writing tongue-in-cheek or whether Marinetti did or did not devise the typography after the fact, than that we have, in any case, a &quot;simultaneous&quot; text that functions very much like a poem. For here it is not just a matter of combining different type-faces, using bold-face and italics, sub-heads and numbered lists, vertical printing, onomatopoeic devices, and white spaces. Rather, <em>double­ entendre</em> and word play begins with the very first phrase, an acrostic</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>in which the capital letters spell out &quot;A bas le passeisme,&quot; and the so-called nonsense words contain such buried words as &quot;elimine&quot; and &quot;enigme.&quot; Again, the manifesto does not just attack such &quot;traditional&quot; poetic features as syntax, the adjective,  punctuation, the line and strophe, and so on; it demonstrates how writing looks when it is stripped of all these things. Not coincidentally, the last item to be suppressed is &quot;}&#39;ennui.&quot; Again, under the heading &quot;CONSTRUCTION,&quot; Apollinaire beats Marinetti at his own game of <em>parole in libertii,</em> creating such comic combinations as &quot;Nomadisme epique exploratorisme urbain <em>Art des voyL1ges</em> et des promenades&#39;&#39;-all these items presented non-hierarchically. Under subhead 2, <em>Intuition vitesse ubiquite,</em> we find complex punning:</p>
<p>Analogies et calembours tremplin lyrique et seule science des</p>
<p>langues calicot Calicut Calcutta tafla Sophia le Sophi suffisant Uffizi  officier  officiel  o  ficelles   Aficionado   Dona-Sol</p>
<p>Donatello Donateur donne a tort torpilleur. (Lista, p. 123)</p>
<p>Here word play like &quot;Uffizi-officier officiel-o ficelles-Aficionado&quot; looks ahead to Dada, as does the musical parody of <strong>&quot;MER</strong></p>
<p>........ DE .......&quot; which becomes <strong>&quot;MERDE&quot;</strong> and is wished on such disparate groups as &quot;Quattrocentistes,&quot; &quot;Ruines,&quot; &quot;Patines,&quot; and &quot;Spirtualistes ou realistes,&quot; the rhymes producing absurd conjunctions. A similar absurdity characterizes the catalogue of contemporary artists to whom ROSE is given:</p>
<p>Severine Pratella</p>
<p>Severini Balla</p>
<p>Kandinsky	Strawinsky</p>
<p>and so on. The typographic form  of  &quot;L&#39;Antitradition futuriste&quot; looks ahead to the <em>calligramme</em> called &quot;Lettre-Ocean&quot; (1914), with its juxtapositions like:</p>
<p>Correos Mexico</p>
<p>4 centavos</p>
<p>U.S. Postage</p>
<p>2	cents	2</p>
<p>or its bold-face nouns placed within the wheel-figure like &quot;LES CHAUSSURES NEUVES DU POETE,&quot; &quot;GRAMOPHONES,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;AUTOBUS,&quot; and &quot;SIRENES.&quot;38 Once the manifesto had set the stage for such <em>parole in libertii,</em> the transformation of the way liter­ ary texts were to be perceived on the page was inevitable.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>There are two things especially worth noting about &quot;L&#39; Antit­ radition futuriste.&quot; First, it takes its materials from earlier manifes­ tos and presents that material in highly condensed elliptical form, juxtaposition replacing any kind of logical or sequential statement. Secondly, the verbal-visual space created by the positioning of phrases, words, and letters, by the acrostics, puns, and catalogues in which discordiant elements are introduced (as in the case of &quot;les maisons,&quot; which is included in the list of grammatical features that are to undergo &quot;DESTRUCTION&quot;), a verbal-visual  space  that could not have existed prior to the invention of the typewriter, has strong affinities with collage composition, as defined in Chapter Two. Within the next few years, the ideograms of Apollinaire and Marinetti gave way to actual pictogram, as in Balla&#39;s &quot;Le Vetement Antineutraliste&quot; of 1914 (see Figure 6) as well as to the &quot;free-word paintings&quot;  of  Marinetti, Severini, Soffici, and Carra (see Figure 7).39 In &quot;free-word painting,&quot; manifesto and collage come together, although not yet in ways as subtle as those used by the Russian Futurists.</p>

<li><em>Improvisation and Theatricality</em></li>

</ol>
<p>-Everything of any value is theatrical.</p>
<p>Marinetti, &quot;The Synthetic Futurist Theatre&quot;</p>
<p><strong>(FM,</strong> p. 193)</p>
<p>In his manifesto &quot;Futurist Painting and Sculpture&quot; (1914), Boc­ cioni declares:</p>
<p>For us the picture is no longer an exterior scene, a stage for the depiction of a fact. A picture is not an irradiating ar­ chitectural structure in which the artist, <em>rather than the ob­ ject,</em> forms a central core. It is an emotive, architectural envi­ ronment which creates sensation and completely involves the observer.... We  therefore  maintain,  unlike  Cezanne,  that <em>the boundaries</em> of the object tend to retreat towards a periph­ ery (the environment) <em>of which we are the centre.</em> <strong>(FM,</strong> p. 177)</p>
<p>The &quot;emotive architectural environment&quot; that &quot;involves the observer&quot; is created, in Futurist manifestos, by a variety of theatri­ cal strategies, the most important being the emphasis on the artist as <em>improvvisatore,</em> creating what Gerald L. Bruns has aptly called &quot;a species of unforeseen discourse&quot;:</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>[Improvisation] is discourse whose beginning is what matters, because to improvise is to begin without second thought, and under the rules there is no turning back Improvisation is</p>
<p>the performance of a composition in the moment of its com­ position. One preserves such a moment by refusing to revise its results....it is discourse that proceeds independently  of reflection; it does not stop to check on itself. It is deliberate but undeliberated.</p>
<p>&quot;Deliberate&quot; because the successful improvisation is designed, in Bruns&#39; words, &quot;to outwit the reader to disrupt readerly expec­</p>
<p>tations and the consequent ability to recognize what is taking place&quot; (p. 148). Improvisation is, in other words, an art that depends not on revision in the interests of making the parts cohere in a unified formal structure, but on a prior readiness, a performative stance that leaves room for accident and surprise. Or at least, in the case of the Futurist manifesto, a stance that pretends to leave such room.</p>
<p>Thus Marinetti declares in &quot;The Birth of Futurist Aesthetic&quot; (1915):</p>
<p>To a finished house we prefer the framework of a house in construction whose girders are the color of danger-landing platforms of airplanes-with its numberless  arms that claw and comb out stars and comets, its aerial quarterdecks from which  the eye embraces a  vaster horizon....</p>
<p>The frame of a house in construction symbolizes our burning passion for the coming into being of things. (Flint, pp. 81-82)40</p>
<p>And in another manifesto of the same year, &quot;The Futurist Synthetic Theatre,&quot; written together with Emilio Settimelli, and Bruno Corra, Marinetti remarks:</p>
<p>. . . a thing is valuable to the extent that it is improvised (hours, minutes, seconds) not exactly prepared (months, years, centuries)....THE GREATER  NUMBER OF OUR WORKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN   IN THE THEATRE .</p>
<p>. . . Our Futurist theatre jeers at Shakespeare but pays atten­ tion to the gossip of actors, is put to sleep by a line from Ibsen but is inspired by red or green reflections from the stalls. WE ACHIEVE AN ABSOLUTE DYNAMISM THROUGH THE INTERPENETRATION OF DIFFE­ RENT ATMOSPHERES AND TIMES. (FM, pp. 194-195)41</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>&quot;A thing is valuable to the extent that it is improvised &quot;-this prefer­ ence for the unfinished, the tentative, and potential, for &quot;girders that are the color of danger,&quot; characterizes the form as well as the ideological stance of Futurist manifesto. Consider the proclamation &quot;Against Past-Loving Venice&quot; <em>(Contro  Venezia  Passatista),</em> printed on leaflets, 800,000 of which were dropped from the top of the Clock Tower in Venice on 8 July 1910, just as the Sunday after­ noon crowd was returning from its weekly excursion to the Lido:</p>
<p>We renounce the old Venice, enfeebled and undone by worldly luxury, although we once loved and possessed it in a great nostalgic dream.</p>
<p>We renounce the Venice of foreigners, market for coun­ terfeiting sprung by caravans of lovers, jeweled bathtub for cosmopolitan courtisans, <em>cloaca maxima</em> of passeism.</p>
<p>We want to cure and heal this putrefying city, magnifi­ cent sore from the past. We want to cheer and ennoble the Venetian people, fallen from their ancient grandeur, drugged by a contemptible mean cowardice in the practice of their little one-eyed businesses.</p>
<p>We want to prepare the birth of an industrial and military Venice that can dominate the Adriatic Sea, that great Italian lake.</p>
<p>Let us hasten to fill in its little reeking canals with the shards of its leprous crumbling palaces.</p>
<p>Let us bum the gondolas, rocking chair for cretins, and raise to the heavens the imposing geometry of metal bridges and howitzers plumed with smoke, to abolish the falling curves of the old architecture.</p>
<p>Let the reign of holy Electric Light finally come, to liber­ ate Venice from its venal moonshine of furnished rooms. (Flint, p. 55)42</p>
<p>The syntactic parallelism of this text is deceptive, for within the seemingly reasonable confines of its declarative statements <strong>(&quot;We</strong> renounce .... ,&quot; &quot;We want ... &quot;), Marinetti introduces a series of outrageous metaphors and hyperboles: Venice as market for &quot;counterfeiting antiquarians,&quot; as &quot;jeweled bathtub for cosmopoli­ tan courtesans,&quot; with its &quot;leprous crumbling palaces&quot; and its &quot;gon­ dolas, rocking chairs for cretins,&quot; Venice as &quot;magnificent sore from the past,&quot; with its contemptible and cowardly tradesmen, practicing &quot;their little one-eyed businesses.&quot; Venice is, in other words, the giant whore, as she is pictured in the caricatures of Andre Warnod that accompanied the text when it was printed in <em>Comoedia</em> in 1910</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>(see Figure 3). Given this graphic emphasis on decayed splendor, a beauty destroyed by venereal disease, the designation of the Adria­ tic Sea as &quot;that great Italian lake&quot; is likely to strike a responsive chord in the reader. Who among the Venetians does not, after all, yearn to make Venice once more the capital of the great Adriatic Empire? In this context, the &quot;reign of Holy Electric Light&quot; surely promises a way out, an escape from the &quot;venal moonshine of fur­ nished rooms.&quot;43 So the cartoonist provides comic &quot;before&quot; and &#39;&#39;after&#39;&#39; pictures (Figure 4). Before: the languid canal with swan-like gondolas; after: the regiment of gondoliers marching with their swords to the beat of the drum. Before: grotesque and flabby lovers smooching in the Piazza San Marco; after, a city of bridges, dirigi­ bles, smoke stacks, and electric lamps, their rays replacing those of the sun. To the left of center, we see a replica of the Eiffel Tower, as if to say that Venice has now become Paris. And of course that is the point of &quot;Contro Venezia Passatista.&quot;</p>
<p>The distribution of leaflets was followed up by an improvised &quot;Futurist Speech to the Venetians&quot; <em>(Discorso futurista di Marinetti ai Veneziani)</em> which provoked a terrible battle. According to R. W. Flint, &quot;The Futurists were hissed, the passeists were knocked around. The Futurist painters Boccioni, Russolo, and Carra punctuated this speech with resounding slaps. The fists of Armando Mazza, a Futurist poet who was also an athlete, left an unforgettable impression&quot; (Flint, p. 56). Marinetti&#39;s address, framed as a series of questions, exhortations, and apocalyptic lyric statements, is par­ ticularly interesting. In a manifesto scorning Romantic love and the tyranny of &quot;veiled women at every twilight tum,&quot; Venice itself is addressed as a woman so seductive that she is hard to resist:</p>
<p>Enough! Enough! Stop whispering obscene invitations to every mortal passerby, 0 Venice, old procuress, who, under your heavy mosaic mantilla, still eagerly prepare exhausting romantic nights, querulous serenades, and frightful am­ bushes!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, 0 Venice, I used to love the sumptious shade of your Grand Canal, steeped in exotic lewdnesses, the hectic pallor of your women who slip from their balconies down ladders woven oflightning, slanting rain, and moonrays to the tinkle of crossed swords.</p>
<p>But enough! All this absurd, abominable, and irritating nonsense nauseates us! And now we want electric lamps brutally to cut and strip away with their thousand points of light your mysterious, sickening, alluring shadows! (Flint, p. 56)</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>In presenting himself as torn between his former absorption in the voluptuous, sensual life of the city and his new faith in its future as an industrial capital, in which the former tour-guides will have useful employment, Marinetti is exploiting the ethical argument: he is the man, he suffered, he was <em>there!</em> Yet we should note that, again, the tone of the discourse is wholly impersonal. Nothing of the poet&#39;s private life is revealed; on the contrary, his role is to speak for one and all, the &quot;we&quot; and &quot;you&quot; brought into intimate collusion:</p>
<p>Oh! Don&#39;t defend  yourselves....</p>
<p>Oh! How we&#39;ll dance on that day! Oh! How we&#39;ll applaud the lagoons, will egg them on to destruction! And what a splendid round dance we&#39;ll have in the illustrious ruins! All of us will be insanely gay, we, the last student rebels of this too wise world! (Flint, p. 57)</p>
<p>Having taken the Venetians into his confidence, having treated them as equals, he can now shrewdly take their innate opposition into account:</p>
<p>All right, shrug your shoulders and shout at me that I&#39;m a barbarian, unable to enjoy the divine poetry that hovers over your enchanting isles!</p>
<p>He begs, wheedles, cajoles, but also scolds:</p>
<p>Shame on you! Shame on you! And you throw yourselves one on top of another like bags of sand to make an earthworks on the border, while we prepare a great strong industrial, com­ mercial and military Venice on the Adriatic Sea, that great Italian lake! (Flint, p. 58)45</p>
<p>Improvising as he goes along (and we must try to imagine what the speech was like when accompanied by Russolo&#39;s noisemakers), Marinetti doesn&#39;t quite know what he will say next, nor does it really matter. He can repeat, underscore, reposition himself, following the paradigm of banter, question-and-answer, exhortation and excla­ mation, hyperbole, personification, absurd metaphysical conceit, and graphic image. The manifesto remains open-ended, its final ref­ erence to &quot;a great strong industrial, commercial, and military Ven­ ice on the Adriatic Sea, that great Italian lake!&quot; repeating, in for­ mulaic style, a phrase from the original proclamation:</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>We want to prepare the birth of an industrial and military Venice that can dominate the Adriatic Sea, that great Italian lake. (Flint, p. 55)</p>
<p>Such variation on the formula can continue as long as the manifesto holds the attention of its audience. And it holds that attention by its continual provocation, its reference, for example, to the  Aswan Dam as an &quot;immense trap with electric folding doors in which the Futurist genius of England imprisons the fleeing sacred waters of the Nile!&quot; If the waters of the Nile can be mastered, why not the Adria­ tic? Once set in motion, the pseudo-logic of the improvisation is implacable: &#39;&#39; Have you forgotten that first of all you are Italians, and that in the language of history this word means: <em>builders of the future?&quot;</em>  By this time, the <em>improvvisatore</em>  has the audience eating out of his hands.</p>
<p>When Marinetti told Henry Maassen that the formula for man­ ifesto art was &quot;violence and <em>precision,&quot;</em> he might have added a third quality that he and his fellow manifesto writers had in abundance­ namely wit. We have already seen the effect of comic hyperbole in &quot;Contro Venezia Passatista,&quot; in which the inertia of the modern Venetian is defined by comparing the gondoliers to &quot;gravediggers trying in cadence to dig ditches in a flooded cemetery&quot; (Flint, p. 57). An even better example of Marinetti&#39; s sense of the absurd is found in the 1914 manifesto called &quot;Down with the Tango and Parsifal,&quot; and subtitled &quot;Futurist letter ciruclated among cosmopolitan women friends who give tango-teas and Parsifalize themselves&quot; <em>(Abbasso ii tango e Parsifal!: Lettera futurista circa/are ad alcune amiche cos­ mopolite che danno dei the-tango e si parsifalizzano&quot; ).</em></p>
<p>The humor of the title is its implication that &quot;parsifalization&quot; (the cult of Wagner) is equivalent to the latest fashion in social dance, in this case the tango. But the equation of tango and Parsifal is also quite serious, Marinetti implying that the revolutionary and nationalist spirit must embrace all areas of cultural life, its fashions in dance or food or clothing as well as in the &quot;high&quot; arts. In order to deflate the high-society cult of both these exotic imports-tango and Parsifal-the manifesto again resorts to catalogues of absurd metaphors, to gigantism:</p>
<p>Monotony of romantic haunches, amid the flashing eyes and Spanish daggers of de Musset, Hugo, and Gautier. In­ dustrialization of Baudelaire, <em>Fleurs du ma/</em> weaving around the taverns of Jean Lorrain for impotent voyeurs <em>a la</em> Huys­</p>
<p>mans and inverts like Oscar Wilde. Last crazy fling of a sen­ timental, decadent, paralytic romanticism toward the Fatal Woman of cardboard. (Flint, p. 62)</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>The image is one of parody <em>fin-de-siecle,</em> of the final death throes of the Romantic tradition of Hugo and Musset, culminating, via Huys­ mans and Wilde-and, one might add, via the young Marinetti himself-in  a  mechanized  (&quot;Industrialization&quot;) cardboard  version of <em>Les Fleurs du Mal.</em> Such hyperbole is punctuated, as so often in Futurist manifesto, by aphorism:</p>
<p>To possess a woman is not to rub against her but to penetrate her.</p>
<p>And again the poet adopts the dialogic mode, responding to his own aphorism with the dismay of the outraged listener:</p>
<p>&#39;&#39;Barbarian!&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;A knee between the thighs? Come! they want two!&quot;</p>
<p>·&#39;Barbarian!&#39;&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;Well then, yes, we are barbarians!</p>
<p>Having declared his willingness to assume this adversary role, the speaker can now invent increasingly absurd fantasies about the en­ raptured tango dancers:</p>
<p>Is it so amusing for you to look each other in the mouth and ecstatically examine each other&#39;s teeth, like two hallucinated dentists? To yank? ...   To lunge? ...    ls it so much fun to arch desperately  over each other, trying to pop each other like two corked bottles, and never succeeding? (Flint, pp. 69-70; ellipses are Marinetti&#39;s)47</p>
<p>And then, having made us laugh, the poet shifts tone abruptly, cast­ ing a cold eye on the concept of fashion in art, even as D. H. Lawrence was to do in manifestos like &quot;Surgery for the Novel or a Bomb&quot; of 1923. Here is Marinetti&#39;s indictment:</p>
<p>Tristan and Isolde who withhold their climax to excite King Mark. Medicine dropper of love. Miniature of sexual anguish. Spun sugar of lust. Lechery out in the open. Delirium tre­ mens. Cockeyed hands and feet. Pantomime coitus for the camera. Masturbated waltz. Pouah! Down with the diploma­ tics of the skin! Up with the brutality of a violent possession and the fine fury of an exciting, strengthening, muscular dance. (p. 70)</p>
<p>Metaphor after metaphor, piled up in abrupt noun phrases, followed by renewed exhortation: down with ... up with! The speaker&#39;s attention then turns to Wagner and the same strictures are applied to</p>
<p>87</p>
<p><em>Parsifal,</em> with its &quot;cloudbursts, puddles, and bogs of mystical tears.&quot; Again the tone is comic-&quot;Tears and false pearls of Mary Magdalen in decolletage at Maxim&#39;s-but the humor is savage, Marinetti making his case for an honest and open sexuality, for a rejection of romantic cant and coyness. His final rhetorical flourish-a sort of last twist of the knife-is to turn the significance of &quot;tango&quot; and &quot;parsifalization&quot; back on those who practice it by informing them that:</p>
<p>Furthermore, you forget <em>this final argument,</em> the only persua­ sive one <em>for you:</em> to love Wagner and <em>Parsifal</em> today, per­ formed everywhere and especially in the provinces ...   to give tango-teas like all good bourgeois all over the world, come come, it&#39;s no longer CHIC! (p. 71)49</p>
<p>This is a good example of the power of improvisation to outwit the reader. For Marinetti has declared, in the opening paragraph of the manifesto, just two pages earlier, that &quot;This epidermic oscillation [i.e., the tango] is spreading little by little through the whole world.&quot; How, then, is the fashion already over? Because, so the text implies, it is the very nature of fashion to disappear before it has fully taken hold. And accordingly the artist&#39;s role is to expose it.</p>
<p>Most readers would grant that &quot;Down with Tango and Parsifal&quot; has great rhetorical ingenuity, that it is a stunning performance. Still, by the norms of Modernist aesthetic, such theatricality is suspect: one thinks immediately of Michael Fried&#39;s argument, first presented in &quot;Art and Objecthood&quot; (1967), that <em>&quot;The success, even the survi­ val of the arts has increasingly to depend on their ability to defeat theatre,&quot;</em> that <em>&quot;art degenerates as it approaches the conditions of theatre.&quot;50</em> An artwork &quot;defeats&quot; theatre when it  is  a  self­ contained, coherent formal structure, adhering to its own medium and genre. When, on the other hand, the artwork has no existence apart from a given situation or environment, when &quot;it depends on the beholder, is incomplete without him ...   has been waiting for him ... and refuses to stop confronting him, distancing him, isolat­ ing him&quot; (p. 140), then it &quot;degenerates&quot;  into  &quot;mere&quot;  theatre. &quot;There is a war,&quot; writes Fried, &quot;going on between theatre and modernist painting, between the theatrical and the pictorial-a war that ... is not basically a matter of program and ideology but of experience, conviction, sensibility&quot; (p. 135).</p>
<p>Fried&#39;s argument is a direct response to the work of such Minimalist (or, as he calls them &quot;Literalist&quot;) artists as Robert Mor­ ris, Donald Judd, and Tony Smith, all of whom were, in the words of Howard N. Fox, &quot;exploring the way in which environment, scale,</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>placement, and repetition could influence the manner in which the most simplified of their &#39;minimal&#39; or &#39;primary&#39; structures-cubes, cylinders, and other basic solids were perceived.&quot;51 Like their Con­ structivist forebears-and most notably Tatlin-the Minimalists of the sixties asserted that their &quot;sculptures&quot; could exist <em>only in rela­ tion</em> to the environment and the viewer, that they were affected by conditions external to their own materiality. It is such &quot;latent or hidden naturalism&#39;&#39;-the claim for objecthood in the real world­ that Fried calls &quot;theatricality.&quot; A related claim, and one that Fried deplores, is the notion brought forward by artists like John Cage that &quot;the barriers between the arts are in the process of crumbling ....</p>
<p>Whereas in fact the individual arts have never been more explicitly concerned with the conventions that constitute their respective essences&quot; (p. 142). And Fried concludes: <em>&quot;The concepts of quality and value--and to the extent that these are central to art, the con­ cept of art itself--are meaningful, or wholly meaningful, only within the individual arts. What lies between the arts is theatre&quot;</em> (p. 142).</p>
<p>Exactly <em>why</em> art &quot;degenerates&quot;  as it approaches  the condition of theatre, or exactly <em>how</em> quality and value inhere only <strong>within</strong> the individual arts and their established divisions is something Fried never really explains. It is assumed that the art object is not to be confused with its environment or its situation in the world, and that its formal structure should be governed by such values as &quot;coher­ ence&quot; and &quot;unity.&quot;  The fact is, however,  that, like it or not,  most art and literature since the mid-sixties has moved away from the formalist canon of High Modernism, and to dismiss such art wholesale  as &quot;non-art&quot; or &quot;non-literature&quot; is not particularly  use­ ful for criticism. Howard Fox observes:</p>
<p>A broader notion of theatricality seems to be required here. Theatricality may be considered that propensity in the visual arts for a work to reveal itself within the mind of the beholder as something other than what it is known empiri­ cally to be. This is precisely antithetical to the <strong>Modern</strong> ideal of the wholly manifest, self-sufficient object; and theatricality may be the single most pervasive property of post-Modem art. (p. 16)</p>
<p>And, we might add, the pervasive property of Futurist art as well-an art that anticipated so much of our own sensibility, our predilection for the &quot;space between the traditional  media&quot;  that Fried dismisses as &quot;theatre.&quot; Consider, in this connection, the ori­ gins of <em>collage,</em> as that form was defined in the preceding chapter. Fox writes:</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>When it first appeared around 1912 in the Cubist experiments of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, collage was less a mixing of media than it was the superimposition of one mode of reality-that is, a <em>non-art</em> reality (in the form of newspaper clippings, simulated wood-grain papers, theater tickets, etc.)-into another mode of  reality-an <em>art</em>  reality. In collage an object such as a theater ticket may remain materially intact yet be <em>virtually</em> transformed within its alien context. Thus, collage embodies a <em>situational</em> aesthetic more than a material one. (p. 14)</p>
<p>It is this &quot;situational aesthetic&quot; that governs what Marinetti called <em>l&#39; arte di far manifesti.</em> Situational in the literal sense, of course, in that the Futurist manifesto has a practical purpose: to move an audience to action or at least to assent in a particular situation, in, say, the &quot;passeist&quot; Venice of 1910. Again, the manifesto is situa­ tional in that it operates in real time and real space; thus &quot;Down with the Tango and Parsifal&quot; is an attack on the cultural and sexual hypocrisy of the Italian upper classes and their bourgeois followers. But the Futurist manifesto is also theatrical in a deeper sense, oc­ cupying as it does a &quot;space that lies between the arts&quot; and conflating verbal strategies that do not conventionally cohere: the ethical and pathetic arguments of classical rhetoric, the rhythm, metaphor, and hyperbole of Romantic lyric poetry, the journalistic narrative of everyday discourse, and the dialogic mode of drama which acts to draw the reader (or viewer) into its verbal orbit. In its assemblage of such conflicting modes and techniques, &quot;Down with the Tango&quot; is an obvious precursor of the performance art of the sixties and seventies-the art that Michael Fried correctly diagnosed as threatening the Formalism of the fifties.</p>
<p>From &quot;Down with the Tango and Parsifal&quot; (1914) to Tristan</p>
<p>Tzara&#39;s first Dada manifesto, the &quot;Manifesto of Monsieur Anti­ pyrine&quot; (1916),52  is a shorter step than the Dadaists would have liked to have us think. Here and in subsequent manifestos, Tzara is eager to dissociate himself from the war-mongering Futurists, with their cult of the automobile and the airplane, their belief in progress, their faith that, as he puts it in &#39;&#39; Dada Manifesto 1918,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;to put out a manifesto you must want: ABC / to fulminate against 1, 2, 3,&quot; whereas his own stance is that &quot;after all everyone dances to his own personal boomboom, and ... the writer is entitled to his boom­ boom.&quot;53</p>
<p>Ironically, this overt rejection of Futurist principles is belied by Tzara&#39;s manifestos themselves, which exhibit the aggressive, polemical tone, the unusual typography (especially in the &quot;Procla­ mation sans pretension&quot; of 1918-see Figure 5) the extensive use</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>of onomatopoeia, pun, and extravagant metaphor, and the &quot;de­ struction of syntax&#39;&#39; and <em>parole in libertii,</em>  all of which are familiar to us from Futurist manifesto. Most important, Tzara adopts the per­ formative stance and the improvisatory structures devised by Marinetti and his followers:</p>
<p>Dada est notre intensite: qui erige les bai&quot;onnettes sans consequence la tete sumatrale du hebe allemand; Dada est la vie sans pantoufles ni paralleles; qui est contre et pour l&#39;unite et decidement contre le futur; nous savons sagement que nos cerveaux deviendront des coussins douillets, que notre anti­ dogmatisme est aussi exclusiviste que le fonctionnaire et que nous sommes pas libres et crions liberte <strong>(TM,</strong> p. 9)</p>
<p>Dada is our intensity: it sets up inconsequential bayonets the sumatran head of the german baby; Dada is life without carpet-slippers or parallels; it is for and against unity and definitely against the future; we are wise enough to know that our brains will become downy pillows that our anti­ dogmatism is as exclusivist as a bureaucrat that we are not free yet shout freedom- (DPP, p. 75)</p>
<p>&quot;Monsieur Antipyrine&quot; (Aspirin) claims indifference to all values: noun phrases in apposition have  no real connection; the bayonets are &quot;sans consequence,&quot; and what should be the German enemy is only a German baby, and with a Sumatran head to boot. Again, Tzara declares with mock-alliteration and assonance that Dada re­ jects both the &quot;pantoufles&quot; of the bourgeois household and the no­ tion of &quot;paralleles&quot; (in the 1918 manifesto, he observes that &quot;Painting is the art of making two lines geometrically established as parallel meet on the canvas before our eyes&quot; <strong>(DPP,</strong> p. 78); Dada, moreover, is both for and against unity, &quot;not free&quot; yet eager to &quot;shout Freedom.&quot;</p>
<p>Here is art approaching the condition of theatre. For Monsieur Antipyrine&#39; s program-or more correctly, anti-program-is gesture rather than substance, his announcement that Dada is &quot;shit after all but from now on we mean to shit in assorted colors and bedeck the artistic zoo with the flags of every consulate,&#39;&#39; is an appeal at least as strong as Marinetti&#39;s to an audience ready to applaud that poet or artist who can <em>epater le bourgeois,</em> and, beyond the bourgeois, who can <em>epater</em> the artists of the ruling culture:</p>
<p>... nous ne voulons pas compter les fenetres de )&#39;elite mer­ veilleuse, car DADA n&#39;existe pour personne et nous voulons que tout le monde comprenne cela. La est le balcon de Dada,</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>je vous assure. D&#39;ou l&#39;on peut ententre les marches militaires et descendre en tranchant l&#39; air comme un seraphin dans un bain populaire pour pisser et comprendre la parabole. <strong>(TM,</strong> pp. 10--11)</p>
<p>. . . we do not want to count the windows of the marvelous elite for Dada exists for no one and we want everybody to understand this because it is the balcony of Dada, I assure you. From which you can hear the military marches and de­ scend slicing the air like a seraph in a public bath to piss and comprehend the parable. (DPP, p. 75)</p>
<p>An anti-militaristic gesture as comically aggressive as any of Marinetti&#39;s military ones. Dada exists for &quot;no one&quot; provided that &quot;you&quot;-Tzara&#39;s audience-agree who &quot;no one&quot; is. Which is to say that, like the Futurists, the Dadaists must explode bourgeois moral­ ity and bourgeois meters:</p>
<p>L&#39; art etait un jeu noisette, les enfants assemblaient les mots qui ont une sonnerie a la fin, puis ils pleuraient et</p>
<p>criaient la strophe, et lui mettaient les bottines des poupees et</p>
<p>la strophe devint reine pour mourir un peu et la reine devit baleine, les enfants couraient a perdre haleine. <strong>(TM,</strong> p. 11)</p>
<p>Art was a game of trinkets children collected words with a tinkling on the end then they went and shouted stanzas and they put little doll&#39;s shoes on the stanza and the stanza turned into a queen to die a little and the queen turned into a wolverine and the children ran till they all turned green. <strong>(DPP,</strong> p. 75)54</p>
<p>Here the tone is more intimate, more equivocal than anything we find in Marinetti; the fairy-tale diction and syntax as well as the tinkling rhymes (&quot;reine&quot;-&quot;haleine&quot;-&quot;baleine&quot;) create an aura of childlike playfulness that makes Tzara&#39;s strictures on conventional meters (&quot;les bottines des poupees&quot;) rather different from Marinetti&#39;s outcry, in &quot;Destruction of Syntax,&quot; against facile sound effects, banal double meanings, monotonous cadences, a foolish chiming&quot; <strong>(FM,</strong> p. 99).</p>
<p>Indeed, the supposition that the manifesto is designed, less to move the masses to action than to charm and give pleasure to one&#39;s coterie, to those who are like-minded, governs the form of Tzara&#39;s own later manifestos as well as Dada manifesto in general. The relationship between the &quot;we&quot; and the &quot;you&quot; begins to shift. <strong>&quot;We&quot;</strong></p>
<p>92</p>
<p>becomes, as it does here for Tzara, subordinated to &quot;I&quot; (&quot;If in exhibiting crime we learnedly say ventilator, it is to give you plea­ sure kind reader I love you so I swear I do I adore you,&quot; p. 76), and &quot;you&quot; is no longer the &quot;you&quot; of the Sunday crowd in the Piazza San Marco but <em>you</em> who are my intimate friends, who are, in Tzara&#39;s words, &quot;sympathiques.&quot;</p>
<p>Given this intimacy, the Tzara manifesto is often indistinguish­ able from a prose poem; its coterie address, its complex network of concrete but ambivalent images, and its elaborate structuring look ahead to Andre Breton&#39;s first Surrealist Manifesto of 1924 and, be­ yond Breton, to many of our own exemplars of conceptual art­ texts no longer claiming to be manifestos and to move society to action, but occupying a similar space between lyric and narrative, or lyric and theatre, or lyric and political statement. Manifesto art thus paves the way for the gradual erosion of the distinction between &quot;literary&quot; and  &quot;theoretical&quot;  texts-an erosion  not  nearly as recent as current polemic would have us think.</p>

<p>1 According to Giovanni Lista, the manifesto in question was <em>Peinture de la Lumiere, de la Profondeur, du Dynamisme;</em> it remained unpublished until 1963, when Severini included it in his <em>Temoignages. 50 ans de reflexion</em> (Roma: Ed. Art. Mod­ eme), pp. 30-31. See Lista, <em>Futurisme: Manifestes, Proclamations, Documents</em> (Lausanne: Editions L&#39; Age d&#39;Homme, 1973), p. 18. Subsequently cited as Lista.</p>

<p>. . . ho letto con molta attenzione ii tuo manoscritto, che contiene cose interessantissime. Pero to devo dire che ha nulla di un <em>manifesto.</em></p>
<p>Anzitutto, ii titolo non va assolutamente, perche troppo generico, troppo gia contenuto nei titoli di altri manifesti. In secondo luogo, devi togliere tutta la parte in cui riprendi ii <em>merda</em> e ii <em>rose</em> di Apollinaire, essendo assolutamente contrario al tipo dei nostri manifesti ii fatto di <em>elogiarne &quot;!no,</em> in un altro manifesto, ripetendone le forme elogiose o insultanti. Inoltre ...    tu non fai che</p>
<p>ridire cio que fu gia detto da me, nel <em>Futurisme</em> e altrove, sulla sensibilita futurista. II rimanente del materiale e molto bello e molto importante, ma</p>
<p>pubblicarlo cosi sarebbe pubblicare un bellissimo articolo, non gia un man­ ifesto. Ti consiglio dunque di riprenderlo e rilavoralo, togliendo tutto ii gia detto, e intensificando, e serrando, tutta la parte nuova in forma di <em>Manifesto</em> e non di articolosintesi della pittura futurista....</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>Io credo che ti persuaderai di tutto cio che mi e dettato dall&#39; arte di far manifesti, che io possego, e dal desiderio di mettere in <em>piena</em> luce, non in <em>mezza</em> luce, ii tuo formidabile ingegno di futurista.</p>

See also Jacques Damase (ed.), <em>La Revolution Typographique depuis Stephane Mallarme</em> (Geneva: Galerie Motte, 1966), pp. xxiii-xxv, 7-13.</p>
<p>31 Mallarme is regularly considered the originator of the &quot;typographical revolu­</p>
<p>tion&quot; in his &quot;Un Coup de des,&quot; first published in 1897; see Damase, pp. Ix-lxii; Arthur Cohen, <em>Dada Spectrum,</em> pp. 76-78; and especially Gerald L. Bruns, <em>Modern Poetry and the Idea of Language</em> (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1974), pp. 101-117. Bruns writes:</p>
<p>... in <em>Un Coup de des</em> typography replaces syntax as a way of establishing relationships among words-that is, as a way of organizing the material of the poem. Syntactical structures are everywhere to be found, but they are radi­ cally diffused by the way the words are positioned on the page. (p. I 15)</p>
<p>But he also implies that here the thrust is to move from the world of things to a world of pure abstraction, of transcendent Idea, and so Mallarme&#39;s typographical experi­ ment can also be seen as the opposite of Marinetti&#39;s. See, on this point, Wendy Steiner, &quot;Res Poetica: The Problematics of the Concrete Program,&quot; <em>New Literary History,</em> 12 (Spring 1981): 537.</p>

<p>34 In reviewing early Futurist exhibitions in Paris, Apollinaire typically made comments like the following:</p>
<p>Futurism, in my opinion, is an Italian imitation of the two schools of French painting that have succeeded each other over the past few years: fauvism and cubism Neither Boccioni or Severini is devoid of talent. However, they</p>
<p>have not fully understood the cubists&#39; painting, and their misunderstanding has led them to establish in Italy a kind of art of fragmentation, a popular, flashy art.</p>

<p>Le futurisme a vecu! C&#39;est <strong>M.</strong> Guillaume Apollinaire, le poete <em>d&#39;Alcools,</em> le romancier <em>d&#39;Heresiarque et er</em> qui lui a porte le coup fatal en signant le manifeste qu&#39;on va lire. II faillait trouver ceci: etre plus futuriste que Marinetti!</p>
<p><strong>M.</strong> Guillaume Apollinaire y a reussi, pour notre joie. Voici le document dont nous regrettons de ne pouvoir respecter entierement l&#39;originalite typog­ raphique.</p>
<p>36 Apollinaire&#39;s reviews of 1913--1914 are much friendlier than the one cited in note 34 above. See, for example, his comments on Boccioni&#39;s sculpture made on 21 June 1913 in <em>L&#39;/ntransigeant (Apollinaire on Art.</em> pp. 320-21).</p>

<p>Noi vogliamo prepare la nascita di una Venezia industriale e militare che possa dominare ii mare Adriatico, gran Iago Italiano.</p>
<p>Affrettiamoci a colmare i piccoli canali puzzolenti con le macerie dei vecchi palazzi crollanti e lebbrosi.</p>
<p>Bruciamo le gondole, poltrone a dondolo per cretini, e innalziamo lino al cielo l&#39;imponente geometria dei ponti metallici e degli opifici chiomati di fumo, per abolire le curve cascanti delle vecchie architetture.</p>
<p>Venga finalmente ii regno della divina Luce Elettrica, a liberare Venezia dal suo venale chiaro di luna da camera ammobigliata.</p>

<p>Basta! Basta! ...  Finiscila di sussurrare osceni inviti a tutti i passanti della terra o Venezia, vecchia ruffiana, che sotto la tua pesante mantiglia di mosaici, ancora ti accanisci ad apprestare estenuanti notti romantiche, querule serenate e paurose imboscate!</p>
<p>Io pure amai, 0 Venezia, la sontuosa penombra de! tuo Canal Grande, impregnata di lussurie rare, e ii pallore febbrile delle tue belle, che scivolano giu dai balconi per scale intrecciate di lampi, di fili di pioggia e di raggi di luna, fra i tintinni di spade incrociate ...</p>
<p>Ma basta! Tutta questa roba assurda abbominevole e irritante ci da la nausea! E vogliamo ormai che le lampade elettriche dalle mille punte di luce taglino e strappino brutalmente le tue tenebre misteriose, ammalianti e persua­ sive!</p>

<p>Alzate pure le spalle, e gridatemi che sono un barbaro, incapace di gustare la divine poesia che ondeggia sulle vostre isole incantratrici!</p>

<p>Monotonia di anche romantiche, fra ii lampeggio delle occhiate e dei pug­ nali spagnuoli di De Musset, Hugo e Gautier. Industrializzaione di Baudelaire, <em>Fleurs du ma/</em> ondeggianti nelle taverne di Jean Lorrain, per &quot;voyeurs&quot; im­ potenti alla Huysmans e per invertiti alla Oscar Wilde. Ultimi sforzi maniaci di un romanticismo sentimentale decadente e paralitico verso la Donna Fatale di cartapesta.</p>
